Low self-esteem has been related to significantly worse depression in people with HIV (PWH). This study explores whether the expression of words related to self-esteem during a 4-session augmented trauma writing intervention predicted post-traumatic stress, depressive symptoms, and health outcomes 6-months later. Ninety-five PWH completed four 30-minute augmented trauma writing sessions in the intervention arm of a randomized controlled trial. One augmented session was devoted to self-esteem. Two individuals coded trauma essays for number of self-esteem words. CD4+ and viral load data were collected, and the Davidson PTSD Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were administered at baseline, one-, and six-month follow-up. Greater total self-esteem words were related to lower depressive symptoms at 6-months, controlling for depressive symptoms at study entry, age, race, and education (t(80)\u2009=\u2009\u22122.235, \u00df\u2009=\u2009\u22120.239, SE\u2009=\u20090.283, p\u2009<\u20090.05, 95% CI [\u22121.195, \u2212.069). Total self-esteem words were not predictive of PTSD, viral load, or CD4+ at 6-months. Exploring self-esteem when writing about and processing a traumatic event could be an important mechanism for decreasing depressive symptoms among PWH. Research is needed to test augmented expressive writing interventions that support efforts to bolster self-esteem in PWH.", "venue": "AIDS Care", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 44, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-07", "journal": {"volume": "35", "pages": "1654 - 1660", "name": "AIDS Care"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Verhagen2023ExploringSD,\n author = {Rachel Verhagen and A.

Desain yang digunakan yaitu pretestposttest control group design. Populasi pada penelitian ini merupakan mahasiswa Fakultas Teknik Universitas Diponegoro angkatan 2018. Pemilihan sampel dilakukan menggunakan teknik convenience sampling. Jumlah sampel yang mengikuti penelitian terdiri dari enam subjek yang dibagi menjadi dua kelompok. Pengambilan data menggunakan Beck Depression Inventory-II. Uji hipotesis menggunakan uji Mann-Whitney U menunjukkan nilai signifikansi p = 0,658 (p> 0,05). Berdasarkan hasil tersebut, tidak ada perbedaan yang signifikan pada penurunan gejala depresi di kedua kelompok. Sedangkan pada uji N-Gain Score, didapatkan rata-rata di kelompok eksperimen g = 17,1 (g< 40). Hal tersebut mengindikasikan bahwa self-compassion writing tidak efektif untuk menurunkan gejala depresi di kelompok eksperimen. Jumlah sampel yang kecil menyebabkan hasil analisis statistik menjadi kurang bermakna bila diterapkan pada populasi. Meskipun demikian, berdasarkan analisis data tambahan melalui wawancara, self-compassion writing dapat mendorong proses kognitif individu untuk mengambil insight dari pengalaman tidak menyenangkan yang pernah terjadi.

The aim of this study is to find out the various sources of anxiety and stress as well as the coping mechanisms among surgeons using qualitative approach of descriptive phenomenology. This study provides analysis of rich textual description of individual experiences of nine surgeons including six orthopaedic surgeons, two general surgeons and one plastic surgeon. In-depth qualitative interviews are conducted and transcribed. Thematic analysis is carried out on the text i.e. identification of codes, themes and sub-themes. A total of twenty-one sub-themes emerged under the three themes of \u2018sources of anxiety\u2019, \u2018sources of stress\u2019 and \u2018coping mechanisms\u2019. The study attempts to find out how these developed coping strategies have an impact on the ability of participants to deal with the problems in their personal life. The sources of anxiety and stress vary according to the phase in the profession such as medical training and practice as well as according to the economic, psychological and social state of the individual.

Whereas initial research focused on concealment (an action a person may take to keep a secret), recent literature documents the broader experience of having a secret. For instance, even if a secret is not being concealed in the moment, one's mind can still wander to thoughts of the secret with consequences for well-being. Integrating several disparate literatures, the present work introduces a new model of secrecy. Rather than define secrecy as an action (active concealment), the model defines secrecy as an intention to keep information unknown by one or more others. Like any other intention, secrecy increases sensitivity to internal or external cues related to the intention. Critically, secret-relevant thoughts are cued in one of two broad contexts: (a) during a social interaction that calls for concealment, and (b) the situations outside of those social interactions, where concealment is not required. Having a secret come to mind in these two very different situations evokes a set of distinct processes and outcomes. Concealment (enacting one's secrecy intention) predicts monitoring, expressive inhibition, and alteration, which consumes regulatory resources and may result in lower interaction quality. Mind-wandering to the secret (when concealment is not required) involves passively thinking about the content of the secret. Engagement with these thoughts may lead to repetitive thinking and rumination, reflection on how one feels about the secret, efforts to cope, or specific plans for how to handle the secret. The model brings together a number of literatures with implications for secrecy, identity concealment, relationships, mind-wandering, coping, health and well-being.

Emotions during goal pursuit are largely unknown, and previous investigations of emotions in weight management have primarily relied on self-report. In this retrospective study, we used a well-validated computational text analysis approach to explore how emotion words changed over time during goal setting and striving conversations with a coach in a mobile weight loss program. Linear mixed models examined changes in emotion words each month from baseline to program end and compared emotion words between individuals who set an overall concrete goal for the program (concrete goal setters) and those who set an overall abstract goal (abstract goal setters). Contrary to findings using self-report, positive emotion words were stable and negative emotion words significantly increased over time. There was a marginal trend towards greater negative emotion word use being associated with greater weight loss. Concrete goal setters used more positive words than abstract goal setters, with no differences in negative emotion words and weight loss. Implications include the possibility that individuals may need increasing support over time for negative emotions expressed during goal setting and striving, and concrete goals could boost positive emotion.

Conclusions Behavioral medicine is grouping treatment methods and interventions that hold large potential for clinical setting. Two groups of methods can be distinguished by the scrutiny and level of evidence gathered in their effectiveness assessment; for biofeedback, guided imagery, and hypnosis techniques, comprehensive evidence reports in the framework of U.S. Evidence Synthesis Program exist. Meditation techniques, disclosure therapies, and relaxation methods are less well assessed.

The current paper aimed to examine if barriers to disclosure may be more salient to sorority women. Participants: We examined differences in rates of hypothetical willingness to formally disclose (N\u2009=\u2009693) and actual formal/informal disclosure (N\u2009=\u2009584) as well as mental health as a function of Greek-life status among college women. Method: Two separate online surveys were administered (October, 2016; January, 2017), respectively. Results: Findings suggest no significant differences in rates of hypothetical or actual formal/informal disclosure as a function of Greek-life status; however, Greek-life members reported lower mental health. Conclusion: Findings from the current studies suggest that institutional factors (e.g., campus climate) may serve as a barrier to disclosure.

Expressive writing (EW) is a writing intervention that requires participants to write about their thoughts and feelings related to a particular event over several days. Methods: Participants in this study included 90 first-year undergraduate students. Participants were assigned to the EW condition (writing about their thoughts and feelings related to their transition to college) or a control condition (writing about any object or event of their choosing). Participants completed 3 consecutive days of writing, and then completed two follow-up visits that occurred one month and six months post-intervention. Participants were divided into two groups based on their initial depression scores (one group with minimal symptoms, and a second group with mild/moderate/severe symptoms). Results: Among participants in the mild/moderate/severe group, those in the EW condition demonstrated significant decreases in depression symptoms over the six-month study period, while participants in the control condition did not. Among this same subset of participants, those in the EW condition also demonstrated significantly fewer physician visits due to physical illness when compared to the control group. Changes in depression and physical illness visits were not found for participants with minimal symptoms of depression. Discussion: EW is a low-cost procedure that has been empirically demonstrated to alleviate symptoms of depression six months post-intervention. However, this finding only held for participants who were initially categorized in the group of participants with mild/moderate/severe symptoms of depression (as opposed to those participants initially categorized with minimal symptoms of depression).

However, in pointing out the limitations of intrapersonal emotion regulation models, it has been suggested that emotion regulation is not confined to intrapersonal processes and the complex social networks that humans form are intricately connected to their emotions. The previous work on financial traders has recognized the relevance of emotions in trading, focusing only on intrapersonal emotion regulation strategies. In this chapter, drawing on the author\u2019s previous research on emotions in trading as well as existing research on social sharing of emotions and interpersonal emotion regulation, interpersonal emotion regulation strategies in the work of financial traders are identified. In doing so, an existing definition of interpersonal emotion regulation is extended and it is argued that while the pursuit of a regulatory goal is paramount, the benefits of interpersonal regulation may be achieved even in the absence of live social interaction, as long as labeling of the affective state takes place. The chapter concludes with a model summarizing intra\u2013interpersonal emotion regulation processes.", "venue": "Research on emotion in organizations", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 68, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-09-11", "journal": {"name": "Research on Emotion in Organizations"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Vohra2018InterpersonalER,\n author = {Shalini Vohra},\n booktitle = {Research on emotion in organizations},\n journal = {Research on Emotion in Organizations},\n title = {Interpersonal Emotion Regulation in the Work of Financial Traders},\n year = {2018}\n}\n"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "29252572", "name": "Shalini Vohra"}]}, {"paperId": "cd5a454fee138693034d6adaa6bba1c94ead2d9c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2810553736", "DOI": "10.1007/s10865-018-9955-2", "CorpusId": 51708054, "PubMed": "30032388"}, "corpusId": 51708054, "publicationVenue": {"id": "ab3982f4-b733-4358-bc74-f7eb389b1c7a", "name": "Journal of behavioral medicine", "type": "journal", "alternate_names": ["J behav med", "J Behav Med", "Journal of Behavioral Medicine"], "issn": "0160-7715", "url": "http://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0160-7715/contents", "alternate_urls": ["http://www.springer.com/medicine/journal/10865", "https://www.springer.com/medicine/journal/10865", "https://link.springer.com/journal/10865"]}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cd5a454fee138693034d6adaa6bba1c94ead2d9c", "title": "Correction To: Past, present or future?

Furthermore, we use machine learning methods to estimate that approximately one third of community members who self-identify with a cancer condition cease engagement due to literal death.

Prevalence studies suggested that adolescents experience at least one potentially traumatic event before reaching age 18. The paradigm of research centered on expressive writing has evidenced the beneficial effects that the emotional disclosure of previous traumas produces on physical health and psychological adjustment. The aims of the study are threefold: determining the prevalence of adverse or traumatic events; examining the extent to which psychopathological symptoms developed in those exposed to traumatic events; and exploring an verbal emotional disclosure (VED) paradigm in which variations on time spent talking about traumatic experiences to others resulted in a reduction of the psychological impact of trauma in a sample of Spanish adolescents. 422 volunteer adolescents participated, 226 boys and 192 girls, from 10 to 19 years old, all of them living in Tenerife. The mean age was 14.8 years (SD = 1.83). All of them completed the instruments used to assess the psychological impact of traumatic experiences and VED. The main results indicated that 77% of the participants had suffered a traumatic situation. The participants who have been exposed to traumatic events scored significantly higher in measures of post-traumatic stress, disorder, intrusive thoughts, avoidance behaviors, anxiety and depression, compared to those without trauma. Furthermore, results show a decrease in symptomatology scores as a function of time spent disclosing emotional experiences to others, particularly when disclosure occurred several times. In conclusion, stressful events or traumatic experiences and their concomitant emotional effects are highly prevalent in adolescents, and repeated VED to others appears to ameliorate their impact. VED shows greater therapeutic benefits when adolescents narrate the experience on several occasions and in an extensive way.", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 48, "citationCount": 11, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00372/pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-03-14", "journal": {"volume": "8", "name": "Frontiers in Psychology"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{P\u00e9rez2017VerbalED,\n author = {S.

At baseline in both studies, participants reflected on a distressing life experience.

One day following the intervention, expressive writing participants in both studies self-distanced more when they reflected over their distressing experience compared with participants in the other conditions, which in turn led them to experience less emotional reactivity 1 month (Studies 1 and 2) and 6 months (Study 2) after the intervention. Analyses using data from both studies indicated that expressive writing reduced physical symptoms indirectly through its effects on self-distancing and emotional reactivity [that is, expressive writing group (vs. comparison groups) \u2192 greater self-distancing \u2192 less emotional reactivity \u2192 fewer physical symptoms].

Disclosure reduced blaming of the victim but did not affect blaming of the nonvictim. Further, the more distress participants disclosed, the less they blamed the victim.

The current study examines these issues in 703 Swedish young adults who endorsed witnessing IPV during childhood. In this sample, 57% reported that they had ever confided in someone about the witnessed violence. The primary reason given for not disclosing was the belief that no one could do anything about it, which was endorsed by 41% of the young adults who kept the violence concealed. Individuals who disclosed the violence were most likely to tell a friend and least likely to use an anonymous hotline. Young adults with higher levels of depression were less likely to have disclosed IPV during their childhood. Individuals\u2019 use of formal reporting outlets was endorsed infrequently, with only 5.2% recalling that they had personally reported the violence or someone else had reported it on their behalf. If such reports were filed, it was most likely to the police. These formal reports typically resulted in participants feeling that the problem continued anyway or that they were believed, but no changes were made. Given the infrequent use of formal reporting services, results suggest that for this sample, reporting outlets for IPV exposure may be underutilized and may not be perceived as beneficial.", "venue": "Journal of Interpersonal Violence", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 40, "citationCount": 20, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Sociology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2015-10-01", "journal": {"volume": "30", "pages": "2886 - 2907", "name": "Journal of Interpersonal Violence"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Howell2015ThePO,\n author = {Kathryn H.

Management involves adherence to pharmacological treatments such as corticosteroids and &bgr;-agonists, but residual symptoms persist. As asthma symptoms are exacerbated by stress, one possible adjunct to pharmacological treatment is expressive writing (EW). EW involves the disclosure of traumatic experiences which is thought to facilitate cognitive and emotional processing, helping to reduce physiological stress associated with inhibiting emotions. A previous trial reported short-term improvements in lung function. This study aimed to assess whether EW can improve lung function, quality of life, symptoms, and medication use in patients with asthma. Methods Adults (18\u201345 years) diagnosed as having asthma requiring regular inhaled corticosteroids were recruited from 28 general practices in South East England (n = 146). In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, participants were allocated either EW or nonemotional writing instructions and asked to write for 20 minutes for 3 consecutive days. Lung function (forced expired volume in 1 second [FEV1]% predicted), quality of life (Mark's Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire), asthma symptoms (Wasserfallen Symptom Score Questionnaire), and medication use (inhaled corticosteroids and &bgr;-agonist) were recorded at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Results Hierarchical linear modeling indicated no significant main effects between time and condition on any outcomes. Post hoc analyses revealed that EW improved lung function by 14% for 12 months for participants with less than 80% FEV1% predicted at baseline (&bgr; = 0.93, p = .002) whereas no improvement was observed in the control condition (&bgr; = 0.10, p = .667). Conclusions EW seems to be beneficial for patients with moderate asthma (<80% FEV1% predicted). Future studies of EW require stratification of patients by asthma severity.

Method Participants were prescreened for their trauma history (N = 78) and randomized to a disclosure or a control writing condition. Pain testing occurred either 1 day or 1 month after disclosure. Capsaicin was applied to the forearm to evoke spontaneous burning pain at the application site and mechanical secondary hyperalgesia in the surrounding untreated skin. Results As hypothesized, the effect of disclosure on the area and intensity of secondary hyperalgesia depended on trauma history and time of testing (F(1,69) \u2265 7.37, p = .008). Disclosure increased secondary hyperalgesia in participants with trauma history compared with those without trauma when testing occurred 1 day after writing (F(1,69) \u2265 5.27, p \u2a7d .025), whereas the opposite pattern was observed 1 month later (F(1,69) \u2265 4.88, p \u2a7d .031). Of the participants with trauma history in the disclosure condition, secondary hyperalgesia was reduced at 1 month compared with 1 day after writing (p = .001). Moreover, greater use of positive emotional words predicted reduced secondary hyperalgesia at 1 month (&bgr; = \u22120.71, p = .022). In contrast, disclosure had no effect on spontaneous pain. Conclusions Disclosure modulates secondary hyperalgesia observed in women with trauma history, producing a short-term enhancement and a long-term reduction. This suggests that disclosure has a long-term protective effect that reduces sensitization of pain, which may explain the therapeutic effects of disclosure in patients with chronic pain.", "venue": "Psychosomatic Medicine", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 58, "citationCount": 16, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Study"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-01", "journal": {"volume": "76", "pages": "337\u2013346", "name": "Psychosomatic Medicine"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{You2014EffectOW,\n author = {D.

High prevalence rates of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression have been found after disasters among affected adults and children, and PTSD is the most distinct and common disorder. However, the challenge of providing sufficient numbers of mental health professionals is the most critical issue facing health-care systems throughout the world, and especially in developing countries. The 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China had enormous destructive power and affected millions of people. Given the large number of people involved \u2013 and the shortage of resources in any major disaster \u2013 brief, pragmatic, and easily trainable interventions are needed for both adult and child survivors. \n \nIn the context of the Sichuan earthquake, this thesis describes a research work aimed at: (1) investigating the extent and nature of earthquake-related distress and positive change experienced by the targeted survivor population, and exploring the factors that predict these distresses and changes, (2) examining the effectiveness of narrative exposure therapy (NET) in adult survivors, and (3) examining the effectiveness of written narrative strategies for child survivors in the school setting. \n \nTo achieve these aims, a cross-sectional survey (N=120) was conducted to explore the psychological morbidities, risk, and protective factors as well as predictive models of PTSD and positive change at 1.5 years after the Sichuan earthquake. It highlights the mental health problems after the earthquake, and provides the background information for the subsequent intervention studies. Sequentially, effectiveness of the narrative exposure therapy was assessed within Chinese adult survivors and modified appropriately via two RCT studies using waiting list control. In the NET-1 study, 22 survivors with diagnosed PTSD were recruited and received the NET treatment. The results supported the effectiveness of NET for treating Chinese earthquake survivors. In the NET-2 study, NET was adapted according to the feedback and practical implications from the NET-1 study. Thirty participants with newly diagnosed PTSD were recruited. Twenty of them were treated by the NET-R, and the other 10 participants were treated by the original NET. The revised NET showed a similar intervention effect to the original NET in reducing PTSD symptoms anxiety, depression, general distress, and negative change, and promoting positive change following adversity. \n \nIn the child intervention studies, a short, inexpensive and easily applied written narrative intervention called Guided Narrative Techniques (GNT) was developed and evaluated with traumatised children in the school setting through two studies. The first study was conducted with 108 sixth grade children (11-12-years old) from three classes in a single primary school, in the earthquake area. Two classes were randomly assigned to the GNT group, and one class was assigned to the expressive writing group that was given simple verbal instruction. The results indicated that if the writing instructions of the programme were fully followed through by the children, GNT might function better on reducing the posttraumatic symptoms than the expressive writing in a short time. However, a low level of writing adherence was reported, indicating that written narrative strategies may not be suitable for traumatised early adolescents. \n \nIn the second child study, the GNT protocol was improved to enhance the writing adherence of children. Eighty-two Chinese fourth grade children (9-10-years-old) from three classes were recruited as participants in the writing programme. One class was randomly assigned to the GNT group; one class was assigned to the GNT condition with encouragement (GNTE group); and one class was assigned to the control group with mixed expressive writing and painting (MEWP) without specific guidelines. The results indicated that all three written narrative strategies appeared to be efficient concerning post-disaster resilience for Chinese school children.

This chapter outlines the physiological basis for the bidirectional relationships between the nervous and immune systems, noting the advancement in the knowledge of how the autonomic system plays a supervisory role in monitoring activity of the immune system. Naturalistic stressors and those created in laboratory settings provide useful models for studying both the acute and chronic influences of psychological states (e.g., stress) on immune function. Furthermore, individual differences in mood and coping strategies may moderate these stress-immune relationships. These individual differences occur within a broader context of social relationships, which provide benefits or impairments in immune function and health. Research on social integration, social support, loneliness, and marriage reveals the importance of the connection between interpersonal relationships and health. Finally, intervention strategies aimed at reducing psychological distress provide hope for individuals suffering from immune-related diseases, including those with cancer and HIV. \n \n \nKeywords: \n \nhealth psychology; \nimmune system; \nstress; \nsocial relationships", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 210, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2012-09-26", "journal": {"volume": "9", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Stowell2012PsychoneuroimmunologyMI,\n author = {J.

Understandably, these disclosures are often rich with emotion. Does emotional disclosure in this context influence consumers' perceptions of fairness? Drawing hypotheses from the emotional disclosure literature, this research reveals that writing about emotions improves consumer fairness perceptions and satisfaction. However, the benefit of emotional disclosure disappears if the disclosure is solicited by the company perceived to be responsible for the unfairness and they do not offer redress. The findings lead to the recommendation that companies provide and facilitate opportunities for consumers to disclose to third parties the emotions arising from consumption experiences perceived as unfair.

Consequently, research considering the impact of such work on providers and organisations is still in its infancy. The first swathe of international research, published throughout the 1990s, identified a range of deleterious effects for treatment providers, ranging from mild anxiety to severe psychological morbidity. More recent findings indicate a considerably more optimistic psychological future. This paper seeks to provide the reader with an overview of the relevant literature, together with its shortcomings, and introduce the Model of Dynamic Adaptation (MDA), a framework through which variables associated with both positive and negative outcomes may be grouped and managed. It is proposed that understanding and managing the MDA can support both individuals and organisations in achieving their goals in good psychological health, through the development and implementation of informed, evidence-based, best practice strategies.", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 90, "citationCount": 32, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2011-06-13", "journal": {"volume": "17", "pages": "335 - 355", "name": "Journal of Sexual Aggression"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Clarke2011WorkingWS,\n author = {J.

Seventy-one Asian and 59 Caucasian undergraduates (N = 130) with at least minimal physical or depressive symptoms were randomly assigned to one of the four writing conditions: emotional disclosure (ED), cognitive reappraisal (COG), the combination of ED and COG, or a control condition. Self-reported physical symptoms, positive affect (PA) and negative affect were assessed at baseline and three follow-ups spanning 4 months. Mixed linear models revealed that COG writing reduced physical symptoms, ED buffered a decrease in PA over time, and the combination of ED and COG (i.e. self-regulation; SR) was most effective.

All participants wrote for twenty minutes over three consecutive days before completing a seven-day daily diary immediately following writing (Time 1) and at follow-up two months later (Time 2). In the diary participants were asked to report on their daily hassles and record subsequent mood (PANAS) and coping (Brief COPE). The DAS-21 was repeated at Time 2 after diary completion. \n \nResults: \nThe data were analysed using hierarchical linear modelling. Analysis found little evidence in support of the main effects of disclosure on mood. Expressive writers were found to report greater negative mood than controls at Time 2. In addition there was no evidence that coping improved with the exception of an increase in acceptance coping for expressive writers over controls. There was little evidence that high baseline depression, mood and alexithymia moderated expressive writing effects. \n \nDiscussion: \nAlthough no support for the efficacy of the GDP was found, the results from this study are important as they highlight the potential costs and benefits of using daily diary studies to assess mood and coping outcomes.

Using this model, the author reviews the empirical research regarding meaning in the context of adjustment to stressful events, outlining what has been established to date and evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of current empirical work.

One personally relevant method of inducing affective states is the written emotional disclosure procedure. The current study examined the immediate effects of written emotional disclosure on secondary hyperalgesia, flare, and spontaneous pain in healthy undergraduate men and women. Fifty-five men and women undergraduates participated in an IRB approved experiment in which they wrote about a traumatic or neutral event fro twenty minutes. After writing, the participants underwent pain perception testing for area of secondary hyperalgesia, flare, and spontaneous pain. Results indicated that women writing about a traumatic experience rated their spontaneous pain as more intense than those writing about a neutral topic, whereas males did not. In addition, men showed greater physiological arousal and area of flare than women. These findings suggest that men and women experience different affective and pain modulatory reactions to written emotional disclosure, though the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated.", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 49, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2010-01-15", "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Smith2010ImpactOW,\n author = {Jerrell Smith},\n title = {Impact of Written Emotional Disclosure and Gender on Capsaicin-Induced Inflammation, Allodynia, and Spontaneous Pain},\n year = {2010}\n}\n"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2109848602", "name": "Jerrell Smith"}]}, {"paperId": "57fa5ef383374a64da983fb346e3f3c46fb4e427", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2120907950", "DOI": "10.1136/jmh.2009.001636", "CorpusId": 5097312, "PubMed": "23674701"}, "corpusId": 5097312, "publicationVenue": {"id": "12ff971e-8c34-4e2d-8300-917faf2b086d", "name": "Medical Humanities", "type": "journal", "alternate_names": ["Med Humanit"], "issn": "2504-5229", "alternate_issns": ["1468-215X"], "url": "https://mh.bmj.com/", "alternate_urls": ["http://mh.bmj.com/"]}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/57fa5ef383374a64da983fb346e3f3c46fb4e427", "title": "Finding a voice: revisiting the history of therapeutic writing", "abstract": "We review the history of therapeutic writing, focusing on the role of narrative competence and the use of writing therapy for stress, trauma and coping with chronic illness.

Narrative competence is defined across two dimensions: (1) Emplotment, or the ability to construct and comprehend goal-oriented connections among temporally situated events; and (2) Meaning, or the ability to understand and communicate contextual interpretations of ambiguous story structures. We suggest that the ability to construct well-organised and meaningful narratives is an important skill for successfully coping with life stressors and trauma, enabling individuals to create coherent stories from fractured memories and to facilitate cognitive processing of traumatic events. Given the positive effect of narrative competence on psycho-physical health, there is a need to broaden medical use of narrative competence therapies beyond the current interventions aimed at fostering empathy among healthcare providers, to include therapies for the patients themselves.

Special attention was paid to contributions by internationally renowned investigators on the subject.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS\nDivorce may be responsible for a decline of physical and psychological health in children. The developmental maladjustment of children is not triggered by divorce itself, but rather by other risk factors associated with it, such as interparental conflict, parental psychopathology, decline in socio-economic level, inconsistency in parenting styles, a parallel and conflicting co-parenting relationship between parents and low levels of social support. Such risk factors trigger maladjusted developmental pathways, marked by psychopathological symptoms, poor academic performance, worst levels of physical health, risk behavior, exacerbated psychophysiological responses to stress and weakening of the immune system.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nClear links were observed between experiencing parental divorce and facing problems of physical and psychological maladjustment in children. Divorce is a stressor that should be considered by health professionals as potentially responsible for maladjusted neuropsychobiological responses and for decline in children's physical health.", "venue": "Jornal de Pediatria", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 119, "citationCount": 54, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/41539/1/2009%20Psychosocial%20adjustment%20and%20physical%20health%20in%20children%20of%20divorce.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Sociology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-01", "journal": {"volume": "85 5", "pages": "\n          385-96\n        ", "name": "Jornal de pediatria"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Nunes-Costa2009PsychosocialAA,\n author = {Rui Nunes-Costa and Diogo Lamela and B.

This article asks whether the empirical literature supports the underlying assumption that emotional expression leads to positive outcomes (better health and dissipation of distress). Studies in which individuals who have been given an opportunity to express emotions about past traumas are compared with subjects placed in appropriate control conditions are reviewed. The empirical literature suggests that eliciting emotion is harmful when it is not associated with reappraisal of past trauma, but helpful when the reappraisal occurs. The following guideline emerges: if trauma is to be revisited, it should be accompanied by reappraisal. Since this is sometimes difficult to engineer, alternative approaches for working with victims of trauma, not involving revisiting the trauma, are offered. Additionally, it is suggested that it can be helpful to identify the nature of the problem arising from the traumatic experience and then provide therapeutic intervention that addresses the problem.", "venue": "Journal of Evidence-Based Social Work", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 106, "citationCount": 17, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1037&context=ssw_facpub", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-05", "journal": {"volume": "6", "pages": "300 - 320", "name": "Journal of Evidence-Based Social Work"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Littrell2009ExpressionOE,\n author = {J.

A next step is to evaluate its clinical utility in \u2018real world\u2019 settings. We adapted the emotional disclosure intervention for use in home-based settings by stimulating the suggested effective ingredients of cognitive-emotional processing, and evaluated its psychological and clinical effectiveness. Reviews indicated the need to examine the physiological changes brought about by emotional disclosure, which may be particularly relevant in immune-mediated diseases. This study was the first to examine neuroendocrine and immune changes after emotional disclosure in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: Sixty-eight patients were randomly assigned to four weekly oral emotional disclosure or time management sessions. At baseline and 1 week and 3 months after the sessions, depressed and cheerful mood, joint scores, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, cortisol, noradrenaline, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), and IL-10 were evaluated. Repeated measures analyses of variance were performed. Results: No effect on psychological well-being and clinical outcome was found (p \u2265 0.10). Cortisol (p = 0.01) and the serum level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3 (p = 0.05) were differentially affected by the two conditions. The change of IL-6 nearly reached significance (p = 0.07). Conclusions: The physiological changes are in agreement with theories on the mechanisms underlying emotional disclosure benefits and are suggestive of better disease control after emotional disclosure. General and study-specific reasons for the absence of psychological and clinical effects are discussed. The findings warn against widespread implementation of this home-based emotional disclosure intervention in unselected rheumatoid arthritis samples.", "venue": "Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 42, "citationCount": 39, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-09", "journal": {"volume": "78", "pages": "145 - 151", "name": "Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Middendorp2009HealthAP,\n author = {H. van Middendorp and R.

Meagher This study was undertaken to determine whether written emotional disclosure of trauma impacted capsaicin induced pain immediately after writing and at a one-month follow-up, and the extent to which a lifetime history of trauma alters pain under neutral conditions. Three experiments were conducted to answer these questions. In Experiment 1 participants were randomly assigned to write about either a neutral or a trauma topic, and they concurrently completed the capsaicin test. In Experiment 2, the capsaicin test was administered to trauma history and no trauma history participants and pain ratings and secondary hyperalgesia were recorded under neutral conditions. In Experiment 3, participants wrote for three days and completed the radiant heat test before writing on day 1 and after writing on day 3. They also completed the capsaicin test on either day 4 or at a one-month follow-up (day 30). Taken together, these studies had several important results. First, radiant heat withdrawal latencies, ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness, and area of secondary hyperalgesia were all significantly increased when participants had a history of traumatic experiences.

While numerous theories attempt to explain the relationship between expressive writing and health, no singular mechanism emerges as conclusive or dominant. This theoretical dilemma is likely due to the paradigm's vast and thus self-fulfilling directions, which place a premium on the participant's biases and positive expectations (Langens & Sch\u00fcler, 2007). Accordingly, the current review builds a theory of perceived control, which makes three propositions: (1) Perceived control promotes health; (2) Traumatic and stressful events lead to loss of perceived control and therefore decrements in health; and (3) Expressive writing restores perceptions of control, thereby improving health. Indeed, perceived control is associated with the very process of expressive writing and has extensive ties to both physical and psychological well-being. Unlike other proposed models, a theory of perceived control identifies which individuals should benefit from writing and explains why health benefits are often short-term. Expressive writing, due to its appeal as a healing ritual, is likely to build up confidence in one's health and prospects, without taking into account the uncertainties of day-to-day events and circumstances.", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 233, "citationCount": 22, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2008-09-01", "journal": {"volume": "2", "pages": "138 - 162", "name": "Health Psychology Review"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Andersson2008ExpectingTH,\n author = {Matthew A.

The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the differentiated effect of two Expressive Writing tasks on female freshmen: the classic task and the classic task enhanced with REBT. Our results indicate that both tasks succeed to significantly reduce levels of depression, nevertheless, only the classic task enhanced with REBT is able to enhance other aspects of the affective life as well. On the other hand, neither task is able to induce significant increases in positive affect. KEYWORDS: emotional disclosure, expressive writing, REBT. (ProQuest: ... denotes formula omitted.) INTRODUCTION Like it or not, stress in its various manifestations and effects, is a real presence in our life. Since it is one of the most important factors for both maintaining and impairing human functioning (Selye, 1976), one could say that it is both a friend and an enemy. If one handles stress adaptively, it could be used in one's own advantage (for example, stress turned into an incentive for further adaptive actions). On the other hand, the literature abounds in well-documented evidence regarding the effects of maladaptive management of intense (traumatic) short- or long-term stressors, moderate long-term distress, or even cumulative minor stressors. These different forms of stress may all seriously impair different aspects of functioning (cognitive, behavioral, physiological, emotional, social, etc.) (Aldwin, 2007; McEwen, 1998; Spiegel, 1999). Obviously, stress bothers us and impairs our functioning most when it becomes our 'enemy'. Maladaptive reactions to stress (on either level of its manifestation), \"can disrupt virtually all aspects of our lives\" (Pennebaker, 2007, p. xiii). In time, by recalibrating or readjusting specific coping mechanisms, one may overcome the negative effects of stress. Sadly, the number of those who fail doing so is increasing; the percentage of individuals complaining of and being diagnosed with pathological levels of mental and emotional disorders is constantly growing (Green Paper, 2005). Emotions: shared and disclosed The expression and sharing of one's emotions after confronting stressful events is an innate, natural need of most individuals (Rime, 2007). Anthropology has recounted that for ages, humans (especially Westerners, but not exclusively) have appealed to this form of relief both in normal and ritualistic contexts (secular or religious, private or public) with the specific purpose of healing (different forms of symbolic healing, for more see Davis-Floyd, 1992; Georges, 2007). In most Western cultures, confession-like forms of disclosure have a long history both in folk understanding and much recently for specialists as well. At different periods of time, one of the major roles of confessional disclosure was that of facilitating self-knowledge (...), either for being able to compare behavior in order to overcome defects (e.g., Stoics), or for exposing hidden thoughts and sins, thus attaining relief (e.g., Christian fate) (for more see Georges, 2007). Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. James 5:16 Come to Me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Matthew 11:28 Later, when confession became mandatory in most Christian religious systems, the 'treatment' of sins via confession got embedded in depth in folkunderstanding as well (Georges, 2007). Early forms of psychotherapy borrowed the function of self-disclosure, slowly altering the primarily religious purposes into more medical ones (Georges, 2007). Since \"with few exceptions, the medium by which people come to alter their self-perceptions is language\" (Pennebaker & Graybeal, 2001, p. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 42, "citationCount": 5, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2008-09-01", "journal": {"volume": "12", "pages": "251", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{K\u00e1llay2008THEBO,\n author = {\u00c9.

Other measures assessed mental and physical health, dyadic satisfaction, and dispositional emotional inhibition.\n\n\nRESULTS\nProtective buffering differed by communicative channel (lexical vs. facial). Caregivers' facial expressions were more positive when the patient was present versus absent. In contrast, the valence of caregivers' words did not differ per patient presence. Facial protective buffering was unrelated to health and dyadic outcomes. Lexical protective buffering was inversely related to both caregiver and patient marital satisfaction. Dispositional emotional inhibition was inversely related to caregiver mental health and marital satisfaction. Desynchrony occurred when the patient was present but was counter to prediction; felt emotion was more positive than expressed emotion.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nResults provide behavioral evidence of facial protective buffering. To the extent that lexical buffering occurs, it poses a dyadic risk, and chronic inhibition poses both psychological and dyadic risks.

Concealment of homosexual orientation can be experienced as chronic stress and be associated with increased levels of physical symptoms. Research suggests that disclosure may produce a reduction in perceived stress, physical symptoms, and physiological activation. The cardiovascular activations levels of 27 healthy adult gay males were measured during resting baseline, a disclosure task (i.e. participants were instructed to talk about the difficulties associated with concealing one's sexual orientation), and a recovery phase. Several 2 (high/low concealment) \u00d7 2 (high/low disclosure) ANOVAs were conducted to determine if there was an interaction between level of concealment and level of disclosure during the recovery period. Results indicated that participants with a high concealment and high disclosure during the study exhibited significantly greater cardiovascular recovery than participants who engaged in a lower level of disclosure.

Outcome and process measures were obtained at baseline, 6\u2010month and 13\u2010month follow\u2010ups. Oncology certified nurses conducted the therapies in six, 30\u2010minute individual phone sessions. Women in the health education condition reported significantly better knowledge and less perceived stress compared to women in the emotional expression and control conditions. No treatment effects, however, were obtained for quality of life or mood, and all women generally improved on these measures over time. Secondary analyses showed that younger women and women with a more advanced stage of breast cancer reported significantly greater avoidant coping. The data show that telephone therapy is a viable delivery modality and that distress improves with time for most women.

The study aimed to explore participants\u2019 views about the emotional disclosure and control conditions. Fifteen participants (N\u2009=\u20099 in intervention and N\u2009=\u20096 in the control group) were interviewed about their experiences of taking part in the RCT. A thematic analysis was undertaken. The process of writing within the study was seen as being different to discussing difficulties verbally. Participants noted notions of resolution, catharsis and a realisation that effective coping had been achieved, as important aspects of the disclosure process. Surprisingly, the participants in the control sample, who had been asked to take part in a supposedly \u2018neutral\u2019 task, indicated that they had found the task emotional. These themes provide some exploratory evidence for the experiential and linguistic models of emotional disclosure.

Written emotional disclosure is intended to reduce stress and may improve health of people with FM.Purpose: This study tests the effects of at-home, written emotional disclosure about stressful experiences on the health of people with FM and uses multiple follow-ups to track the time course of effects of disclosure.Methods: Adults with FM (intention-to-treat, n = 83; completers, n = 72) were randomized to write for 4 days at home about either stressful experiences (disclosure group) or neutral time management (control group). Group differences in immediate mood effects and changes in health from baseline to 1-month and 3-month follow-ups were examined.Results: Written disclosure led to an immediate increase in negative mood, which did not attenuate across the 4 writing days. Repeated-measures analyses from baseline to each follow-up point were conducted on both intention-to-treat and completer samples, which showed similar outcomes. At 1 month, disclosure led to few health benefits, but control writing led to less negative affect and more perceived support than did disclosure. At 3-month follow-up, these negative affect and social support effects disappeared, and written disclosure led to a greater reduction in global impact, poor sleep, health care utilization, and (marginally) physical disability than did control writing. Interpretation of these apparent benefits needs to be made cautiously, however, because the disclosure group had somewhat poorer health than controls at baseline and the control group showed some minor worsening over time.Conclusions: Written emotional disclosure can be conducted at home, and there is tentative evidence that disclosure benefits the health of people with FM. The benefits, however, may be delayed for several months after writing and may be of limited clinical significance.", "venue": "Annals of Behavioral Medicine", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 78, "citationCount": 100, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/abm/article-pdf/32/2/135/22542055/12160_2008_article_322135.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2006-10-01", "journal": {"volume": "32", "pages": "135-146", "name": "Annals of Behavioral Medicine"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Gillis2006TheHE,\n author = {M.

The cytotoxic function, or \u2018killing activity\u2019 of NK cells has become important in studies of the effects of stress and other psychosocial factors on physical health. Unfortunately, research on NK cell function has been plagued by discrepancies in the methods of interpreting NK cytotoxicity data. We briefly review some of the variations in measuring NK cell activity and present a new model for interpreting these results, introducing maximal target cell lysis (A) and the slope of the cytolytic curve (k) as parameters that attempt to make full use of the information and the statistical power in NK cell cytotoxicity data. Examples of these interpretation methods are presented using NK cytotoxicity data from a group of metastatic breast cancer patients. This approach will be useful in applications of NK cell measurement in psychoneuroimmunology research.

Writing was analyzed using the linguistic inquiry and word count program. Writing characteristics that were examined included: average word count, number of journal entries, positive and negative emotion words, the ratio of positive to negative words, and the use of cognitive mechanism words (i.e. insight and causal words). Regression analyses revealed that increased levels of anxiety and depression, post\u2010intervention, were predicted by the prevalence of negative emotion in writing. Unique variance in mood (anxiety and depression) was accounted for by expression of negative emotion (7 and 6%, respectively). These relationships were significant (p<0.05) and remained significant even after accounting for pre\u2010intervention levels of distress, and for the quantity and frequency of writing. These findings suggest the need for additional research into the naturalistic application of journaling so that appropriate recommendations for writing (e.g. focus, timing, amount) can be offered to patients who might choose to utilize this approach for coping with the stresses of cancer diagnosis and treatment.

A full systematic review was undertaken, with standard health technology appraisal methods, with the aim to assess the effects of emotional disclosure on healthy participants and those with pre-existing morbidity, particularly on longer-term physical health, performance, and psychological outcomes. Methods: Randomized controlled trials of emotional disclosure were obtained from database searches (Medline (1966\u20132003), Embase (1980\u20132003), Cochrane Library (2002, issue 4), Web of Science (1981\u20132003), Cinahl (1982\u20132003), and Theses (March 2003), Internet sites (including Professor J.W. Pennebaker's home pages), and personal contacts. Quality was assessed qualitatively and by Jadad score. Meta-analysis was conducted, using Revman 4.1 software, where more than two trials reported the same outcome. Results: Sixty-one trials were found meeting the inclusion criteria. Most had less than 100 participants and the median Jadad score was 0. A wide variety of physical, physiological, immunological, performance, and psychological outcomes were measured, but fewer were reported.

It addresses both the quantity and quality of secret-keeping. With respect to quantity, it presents research on the intra- and interpersonal consequences of keeping secrets from parents in adolescence. With respect to quality, it presents research that investigates and compares two types of secrets: Secrets that are kept all to oneself and secrets that are shared with at least one confidant. The research presented in this dissertation shows that keeping secrets from parents and keeping secrets all to themselves may have important ramifications for adolescents' sense of worth, their emotions, their behavior, and their relationships with their parents. It also suggests that, contrary to popular belief, not all secrets are harmful. In fact, individuals may benefit from having shared secrets.", "venue": "", "year": 2005, "referenceCount": 192, "citationCount": 8, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2005-02-22", "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Frijns2005KeepingS,\n author = {T.

Little is known about health behaviors that are associated with better quality of life among recently bereaved older persons.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this community-based longitudinal, observational study was to examine the influence of health behaviors on the quality of life of 200 elderly bereaved persons.\n\n\nDESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS\nHealth behaviors (i.e., exercise, monitoring caloric intake, sleep, daily vitamin intake, annual health check-ups) were examined at approximately 6 months postloss (baseline) and 11 months postloss (Wave 2). Quality of life was assessed at approximately 11 months postloss and 19 months postloss (Wave 3), using the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, which measures 8 domains of health and functioning, plus a single item assessing change in health.\n\n\nRESULTS\nConsistently exercising 1 or more days per week at Waves 1 and 2 significantly (p < .05) predicted better self-rated health, physical functioning, fewer physical role limitations, and greater energy at Wave 3 in models that adjusted for age, gender, prior psychiatric disorder, baseline reports of functional disabilities and chronic conditions. Consistently monitoring caloric intake at Waves 1 and 2 predicted better self-rated health (p < .05), greater energy (p < .01), and positive change in health (p < .05) at Wave 3 in models that adjusted for the above set of control variables.

A Randomized Trial", "abstract": "Objective: Nonpharmacologic treatments for asthma may act as useful adjuncts to pharmacotherapy but should be recommended to patients only after several well-controlled studies provide evidence of efficacy. Research demonstrating that written emotional expression can improve pulmonary function in patients with asthma consists of one impressive yet unreplicated study (1). Our main objective was to test and extend previous research finding that written emotional expression improves pulmonary function in patients with asthma compared with writing on neutral topics. Methods: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of outpatient asthmatics recruited from hospitals and the community. Of the 137 adult patients with asthma who were randomized, 117 began and 114 completed the study. Patients were randomly assigned to write for 20 minutes, once per week, for 3 weeks about stressful experiences (n = 41), positive experiences (n = 37), or neutral experiences (n = 36; control group). At baseline, postintervention, and 2-month follow up, patients were assessed by spirometry. Results: The mean change from baseline to 2-month follow up in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 4.2% in the stress-writing group, 1.3% in the positive-writing group, and 3.0% in the control group. In forced vital capacity (FVC), there was 3.1% improvement in the stress-writing group, 3.6% in the positive-writing group, and 2.4% in the control group. These changes were not statistically or clinically significant. Conclusions: The present study reduces confidence in the ability of written emotional expression to benefit the disease status of asthma patients.

This study sought to identify individual difference moderators of the effects of written disclosure among women with chronic pelvic pain. Methods In a prospective, randomized trial, 48 women with chronic pelvic pain completed 3 individual difference measures and then wrote for 3 days about stressful consequences of their pain (disclosure) or positive events (control). Health status was assessed at baseline and 2 months after writing. Results Main effect group comparisons indicated that disclosure writing resulted in significantly lower evaluative pain intensity ratings than control writing at follow-up, but there were no main effects on other outcome variables (sensory or affective pain, disability, affect). Three baseline individual difference measures, however, significantly moderated group effects. Compared with control writing, disclosure led to less disability among women with higher baseline ambivalence over emotional expression or higher catastrophizing, and to increased positive affect among women with higher baseline negative affect. Ambivalence, but not catastrophizing, was independent of negative affect in its moderation effect. Conclusion Although the main effects of writing about the stress of pelvic pain are limited, women with higher baseline ambivalence about emotional expression or negative affect appear to respond more positively to this intervention.", "venue": "Psychosomatic Medicine", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 61, "citationCount": 187, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Study", "ClinicalTrial"], "publicationDate": "2004-03-01", "journal": {"volume": "66", "pages": "174-183", "name": "Psychosomatic Medicine"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Norman2004ForWD,\n author = {S.

It represents the first attempt to translate the expressive writing intervention into a low-cost, community-based intervention in the form of a videotaped program.Methods: Feasibility of the approach and patient adherence were examined in a community rheumatology practice with rheumatoid arthritis patients (N = 373).Results: The videotape format was able to convey the intervention instructions accurately and produced the expected and differential ratings of stressfulness and emotional provocation across the 3 writing programs. Seventy-nine percent of eligible patients agreed to take the program home; 49% of these patients reported that they followed the protocol. Physician Disease Activity Rating and the Physical Component Summary of the SF36v2 Health Survey were assessed pre and post program.Conclusions: Intent-to-treat analyses found no effect of the treatment. Pretreatment differences among the protocol-adherent patients complicated treatment outcome interpretation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the Interactive Educational Videotaped Interventions (IEVI) designed to prevent HPN complications of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI), to prevent reactive depression (from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition definition), and to increase patients' frequency of problem-solving with professionals.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was used to test IEVI that engaged patients in infection and depression prevention and problem-solving activities with professionals. The primary outcome measure was CR-BSIs, while reactive depression and problem solving were secondary outcomes. Quality of life and satisfaction with interventions, also secondary outcomes, were evaluated at 18 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with controls, there was a lower frequency in the experimental group of CRBSIs (chi2 = 4.82, p = .03), reactive depression (chi2 = 4.50, p = .03), and rehospitalization for CR-BSIs (chi2 = 5.73, p = .01). There was greater use of problem solving in the experimental group (chi2 = 4.33, p = .038). These differences occurred at the primary endpoint of 6 months after administration of the interventions. At the 18-month follow-up, there were fewer CR-BSIs (chi2 = 4.42, p = .035), and fewer hospitalizations for infection (chi2 = 5.729, p = .01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe IEVI reduced CR-BSIs and reactive depression and increased problem solving with professionals. IEVI use also can result in fewer hospitalizations and improved quality of life.

Treatment proved most beneficial for participants who had suffered from intentional trauma and those who had not previously discussed the traumatic events with significant others.

Emotional approach coping (EAC), however, is a type of emotion-focused coping that appears to be adaptive in some nonpain populations but has not yet been examined in a chronic pain population. In a sample of 80 patients (75% women, M = 48.67 years of age) with chronic myofascial pain, we contrasted how EAC (assessed with the Emotional Approach Coping Scale) and 5 passive pain-coping strategies (assessed with the Vanderbilt Multidimensional Pain Coping Inventory (VMPCI)) were related to sensory and affective pain, physical impairment, and depression. Passive coping strategies were positively correlated with one another, but EAC was inversely correlated with most of them. The VMPCI passive strategies were substantially positively related to negative affect, whereas EAC was inversely related to negative affect. Controlling for potentially confounding demographics, higher EAC was related to less affective pain and depression, even after controlling for negative affect. Using passive coping strategies, in contrast, was associated with more pain, impairment, and depression, although these relations were greatly attenuated after controlling for negative affect. When considered simultaneously, EAC, but not passive coping, was related to affective pain, and both EAC and passive coping were significant correlates of depression, although in opposite directions. In secondary analyses, we found that EAC was related to less pain (particularly sensory) among men and to less depression among women. Unlike the use of passive pain-coping strategies, which are associated with worse pain and adjustment, the use of EAC (emotional processing and emotional expression) with chronic pain is associated with less pain and depression. This suggests that some emotion-focused types of pain coping may be adaptive, and it highlights the need to assess emotional coping processes that are not confounded with distress or dysfunction.", "venue": "Annals of Behavioral Medicine", "year": 2002, "referenceCount": 56, "citationCount": 85, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/abm/article-pdf/24/4/326/22542229/12160_2008_article_244326.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2002-11-01", "journal": {"volume": "24", "pages": "326-335", "name": "Annals of Behavioral Medicine"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Smith2002ContrastingEA,\n author = {Julie-Anne Smith and M.

Patients were randomly assigned individually to either a casual content writing control group (n = 19) or a trauma content writing experimental GDP group (n = 22). GDP patients wrote about an upsetting event chronologically (day 1), verbally described their thoughts and feelings and described the event's impact on life (day 2), and finally wrote about their current perspective on and future coping with the event (day 3). Three months later, patients were reassessed blindly for symptoms and clinic visits, and an average of 15 months later they were assessed blindly for clinic visits again.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with controls, GDP patients reported lower symptom levels at 3 months (2.3 versus 5.2), and made fewer clinic visits during the 3 (1.3 versus 3.0) and 15 month (5.1 versus 9.7) follow-ups. The percentage of GDP patients making > or =10 visits during the 15 month follow-up was smaller (10%) than among controls (33%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings extend previous findings to frequent clinic users, using a new form of written disclosure aimed at shifting trauma from implicit to explicit memory.

Self-confrontation with traumatic memories, by putting painful emotions and thoughts into (verbal) words, is associated with psychophysiological benefits. Self-confrontation may be invoked during sessions and enhanced by structural assignments, which the client carries out between the sessions. In this context, writing assignments could be a useful tool in reprocessing traumatic events. The effects of writing assignments have been demonstrated in several case studies and in a number of experimental studies. However, the experimental studies have several limitations, for example the effects of writing on the impact of trauma are not examined. Furthermore, the psychological mechanisms that mediate the effects of trauma on health are less clear. These two issues are the main issues of the current study. Methods: A group of 26 participants were instructed to write about their negative events during five 45-min sessions over a period of 2 weeks. They were compared at pre-treatment, post-treatment and at 6-week follow-up to a waiting-list control group (n = 22). Results: The trauma-writing groups experienced fewer intrusions and showed less avoidance behavior from pre-treatment to follow-up, whereas the waiting-list control group did not change significantly. Similar results were found on depressive symptoms. No effects on mood measures were found.

Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using the Gottschalk-Gleser and Referential Activity scales. Of the Gottschalk-Gleser scales, only Hdl was considered. ResultsAs hypothesized, the regression of emotion-related scores on CD4 + levels showed a curvilinearrelationship with Hdl scores, and a linearrelationship with RA scores.

Methods Subjects were 56 healthy volunteers. Heart rate and blood pressure were assessed at regular intervals during a 30-minute adaptation period and a 6-minute videotaped speech task. Blood was drawn before and after the task and was assayed for natural killer cell activity (NKCA), cortisol production, in vitro interferon gamma (IFN-&ggr;) and interleukin 10 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and antibody titers to the Epstein-Barr virus. Psychological measures were also administered. Results NKCA increased significantly in response to the task, and this increase was significantly and positively correlated with heart rate reactivity. IFN-&ggr; production by PBMC also increased in response to the task, but these increases were unrelated to heart rate reactivity. In addition, baseline cortisol levels were found to be predictive of heart rate reactivity. Finally, questionnaire data were modestly related to various aspects of stress-induced reactivity. Conclusions Consistent with the task-related increases in NKCA and IFN-&ggr;, acute stress may signal an increase in at least some aspects of the cell-mediated, or TH1-driven, immune response. Furthermore, the finding that heart rate reactivity was related in part to baseline individual differences in cortisol production suggests that short-term cardiovascular responses to stress may be directly related to longer-term neuroendocrine modulation. Finally, the present results also help to highlight the influence of both sympathetic and nonsympathetic pathways in the response to acute stressors and suggest tentative links between certain psychological traits and various aspects of stress-induced reactivity.", "venue": "Psychosomatic Medicine", "year": 2001, "referenceCount": 74, "citationCount": 72, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2001-05-01", "journal": {"volume": "63", "pages": "493-501", "name": "Psychosomatic Medicine"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Larson2001HeartRN,\n author = {M.

Self-disclosure has also been linked, albeit less consistently, to improved psychological health. The present study examined the physiological and psychological consequences of children\u2019s self-disclosure of their HIV/AIDS status to friends. Methods: Data were collected twice, one year apart, from 64 caregiver-child dyads in which all of the children were infected with HIV. Dependent variables included the child\u2019s CD4%, self-concept, and level of behavioral problems. Results: Children who had disclosed their HIV+ diagnosis to friends during the 1-year course of the study had a significantly larger increase in CD4% than children who had told their friends before the study or those children who had not yet disclosed their HIV+ diagnosis to friends. This effect remained significant when the child\u2019s age and level of medication (protease inhibitors) were statistically controlled. Self-disclosure to friends did not impact the child\u2019s behavior or self-concept. Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate the effect of self-disclosure in children.

In view of the pressures of managed care providing an environmental challenge not to simply do less of the same (Hoyt, 1995; Hoyt & Carlson, 1997), I read Professor L\u2019Abate\u2019s (1999, this issue) article with keen interest. Although his attack against com monly accepted sacred cows and his taking the bull by the horns sometime seem a bit like tilting at windmills\u2014to twist the bovine metaphor yet further\u2014he is, in my opinion, right to suggest that mental health clinicians will need new ways to reach and serve clients if we are to remain a large and viable profession. Professor L\u2019Abate (1999) nicely differentiates effectiveness from efficiency and distinguishes various levels of intervention. He then launches what seems to be a somewhat excessive offensive against sacred cow number 1, talk as a therapeutic means, which he characterizes as \u201ca very expensive, inefficient, and uncontrollable medium\u201d that receives \u201cinordinate use\u201d and is \u201cpatently inefficient, as shown by most evidence\u201d (p. 207). At times, he seems to almost ignore the findings of important large-scale outcome studies (e.g., Mental Health, 1995; Seligman, 1995; Smith, Glass, & Miller, 1980) that have shown talk-based therapy to be helpful\u2014 although he cites some of the work of Orlinsky and Howard (Howard, Kranser, & Orlinsky, 1986) elsewhere within the paper. We may also have oversold the enduring effects of ther apy rather than recognize the value of more naturalistic inter mittent or episodic treatment\u2014see Cummings and Sayama (1995) and Jacobson (1995). He also complains, at some length, about the many hours of technical time needed to tran scribe and classify 1 hour of talk therapy. Most practitioners are not involved in systematic research, and it was not clear why, \u201cif there is no recording, the only record available is the notes written by the therapist. Respondents are exempted from remembering and acting on what was said, leaving the responsibility for changes back to the professional\u201d (L\u2019Abate, 1999, p. 208). If clients are having difficulty following through, why not try the following: modify assignments, practice in session, discuss resistance, tape-record, write brief summaries of sessions and homework (or perhaps have clients write the summaries), or consider other means to ther apeutic ends (see Hoyt & Miller, in press)? Professor L\u2019Abate cites a study (Esterling, Antoni, Fletcher, Margulies, & Schneiderman, 1994) that showed \u201cno significance differ ence between talking in a microphone or distance writing\u201d and notes that \u201ctalking in a microphone may be a preferred mode of interaction (Szell, 1994),\u201d but then disfavors talking in a microphone because it would be \u201cvery expensive to reduce talking into writing for content analyses, coding, and classification\u201d (L\u2019Abate, 1999, p. 210). Sacred cows numbers 2 and 3, the value of seeing a professional face-to-face and the significance of the therapeutic alliance, also seem to get short shrifts, despite L\u2019Abate (1999) citing the work of Lambert (1986, 1989; also see Miller, Duncan, & Hubble, 1997) that found the quality of the therapeutic alliance (a form of human relationship) to be the factor most predictive of therapeutic outcome. He references two recent Internet studies, one of which (Parks & Roberts, 1998) seems to suggest that users were forming ongoing personal relationships online, whereas the other study (Kraut et al., 1998) sounds the caution that \u201cgreater use of the Internet was associated with declines in participants\u2019communication with family members in the household, declines in the size of their social circle, and increases in their depression and loneliness\u201d (p. 1017). Another recent Internet study (Turkle, 1995) has found hundreds of thousands of users spending several hours to virtually all of their waking time daily on the Internet. As clinicians, we have heard more and more complaints of com puters replacing real relationships. Don\u2019t get me wrong. As I remarked (Hoyt, 1996) in a conversation published else where, \u201cThe information and networking possibilities are thrilling, but I hope \u2018virtual reality\u2019 and \u2018cybersex\u2019 won\u2019t replace older forms!\u201d (p. 363). Professor L\u2019Abate (1999) notes that the therapeutic alli ance may present special problems for working with psy chotic, paranoid, criminal, and character-disordered clients, and also makes the good point that highly dysfunctional cou ples and families especially may require specific interven tions directed toward conflict-reducing skill enhancement.", "venue": "", "year": 1999, "referenceCount": 26, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "1999-07-01", "journal": {"volume": "7", "pages": "224 - 226", "name": "The Family Journal"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Hoyt1999CommentOL,\n author = {M.

New psychological interventions that may challenge the sacred cows as we know them are as follows: (a) psychoeducational skill training programs; (b) computer assisted interventions, including verbal, visual (i.e., virtual reality), and neurobiofeedback; (c) manualized therapies; (d) eye movement desensitization and reprocessing; and (e) programmed distance writing, as exemplified by mental health workbooks.

Research has demonstrated that writing about emotionally traumatic experiences has a surprisingly beneficial effect on symptom reports, well-being, and health care use in healthy individuals.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine if writing about stressful life experiences affects disease status in patients with asthma or rheumatoid arthritis using standardized quantitative outcome measures.\n\n\nDESIGN\nRandomized controlled trial conducted between October 1996 and December 1997.\n\n\nSETTING\nOutpatient community residents drawn from private and institutional practice.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nVolunteer sample of 112 patients with asthma (n = 61) or rheumatoid arthritis (n = 51) received the intervention; 107 completed the study, 58 in the asthma group and 49 in the rheumatoid arthritis group.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nPatients were assigned to write either about the most stressful event of their lives (n = 71; 39 asthma, 32 rheumatoid arthritis) or about emotionally neutral topics (n = 41; 22 asthma, 19 rheumatoid arthritis) (the control intervention).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nAsthma patients were evaluated with spirometry and rheumatoid arthritis patients were clinically examined by a rheumatologist. Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 2 weeks and 2 months and 4 months after writing and were done blind to experimental condition.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf evaluable patients 4 months after treatment, asthma patients in the experimental group showed improvements in lung function (the mean percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] improved from 63.9% at baseline to 76.3% at the 4-month follow-up; P<.001), whereas control group patients showed no change. Rheumatoid arthritis patients in the experimental group showed improvements in overall disease activity (a mean reduction in disease severity from 1.65 to 1.19 [28%] on a scale of 0 [asymptomatic] to 4 [very severe] at the 4-month follow-up; P=.001), whereas control group patients did not change. Combining all completing patients, 33 (47.1%) of 70 experimental patients had clinically relevant improvement, whereas 9 (24.3%) of 37 control patients had improvement (P=.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPatients with mild to moderately severe asthma or rheumatoid arthritis who wrote about stressful life experiences had clinically relevant changes in health status at 4 months compared with those in the control group. These gains were beyond those attributable to the standard medical care that all participants were receiving. It remains unknown whether these health improvements will persist beyond 4 months or whether this exercise will prove effective with other diseases.", "venue": "Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)", "year": 1999, "referenceCount": 34, "citationCount": 812, "influentialCitationCount": 24, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Study", "JournalArticle", "ClinicalTrial"], "publicationDate": "1999-04-14", "journal": {"volume": "281 14", "pages": "\n          1304-9\n        ", "name": "JAMA"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Smyth1999EffectsOW,\n author = {J.

A theory of inhibition has been put forward that summarizes the process by which failure to confront emotionally traumatic events results in poorer health (see Pennebaker 1989). The principal assumption of this theory is that actively inhibiting ongoing behaviors, thoughts, or emotional feelings, entails physiological work, in the form of increased autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. Over time, the physiological consequences of inhibition serve as a long-term low-level Stressor (cf., Selye 1976), causing or exacerbating psychosomatic processes and thereby increasing the risk of illness and a variety of stress-related diseases. Many studies have been conducted whose findings support the inhibition model. With respect to ANS activity, the suppression of overt emotional expressions, defined as the conscious inhibition of emotional expressive behavior while emotionally aroused, has been shown to be associated with increased skin conductance levels (SCLs) (Gross and Levenson 1993). Similarly, experiments have demonstrated that instructions to suppress thoughts are associated with higher SCLs (e.g., Wegner, Shortt, Blake and Page 1990). With respect to longer-term inhibition and specific health problems, the inhibition of anger has been associated with coronary heart disease (e.g., Haynes, Feinleib and Kannel 1980), and hypertension (e.g., Dimsdale, Pierce, Schoenfeld, Brown, Zusman and Graham 1986). It has also been suggested that emotional inhibition may be linked to the onset and progression of cancer (Gross 1989; Temoshok 1987). Indeed, sustained inhibition has been linked with various other disorders such as skin disorders, asthma and also pain (see Traue and Pennebaker 1993).", "venue": "", "year": 1998, "referenceCount": 49, "citationCount": 5, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "1998-03-01", "journal": {"volume": "130", "pages": "1 - 82"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Lee1998WhyTA,\n author = {V.

After controlling for demographics (gender, race, education, disability status), disease measures (duration of diagnosis, objective disease activity), and life stress, we found that pain was related to an increased expression of negative emotion; physical dysfunction was related to an increased frequency of thinking about stressful events; and affective disturbance was related to both increased ambivalence about emotional expression and increased thought frequency.

Data came from a longitudinal psychosocial study associated with the Los Angeles site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Eighty gay men, HIV-seropositive but otherwise healthy at study entry (CD4 T lymphocytes = 30-60% of total lymphocytes), were examined at 6-month intervals for 9 years. Indicators of HIV progression included time to a critically low CD4 T lymphocyte level (15% of total peripheral blood lymphocytes), time to AIDS diagnosis, and time to AIDS mortality. On all measures, HIV infection advanced more rapidly in a dose-response relationship to the degree participants concealed their homosexual identity. Sample characteristics and statistical controls ruled out explanations based on demographic characteristics, health practices, sexual behavior, and antiretroviral therapy. Mediational analyses indicated that observed effects were not attributable to differences in depression, anxiety, social support, or repressive coping style.

Among subjects in the self-disclosure condition, high hostility subjects exhibited a significantly greater increase in NK cell cytotoxicity than low hostility subjects.

These studies have focused on coping, depression, negative expectancies and social support as predictors.

Affect, beliefs, and behaviour are all seen as important. Biological variables, SES and psychological resources that the person brings to the situation and external stresses are seen as important variables to consider in prediction studies. The pathways through which these four strategies may operate (both psychological and biological) to impact on health are discussed. Psychological pathways include distress and behavioural disengagement, while biological pathways involve the sympathetic nervous system, neuroendocrine and immune mediation.

The present study aimed to predict pregnancy distress based on the emotional self-disclosure and self-regulation. Materials and Methods: The statistical population of this descriptive study included all pregnant women referred to a pregnancy care centers in June 2016, among whom 240 were selected based on convenient sampling. The questionnaires of pregnancy distress, emotional self-disclosure, and self-regulation were used for collecting data. The collected data were analyzed by using Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis. Results: The results indicated a significant relationship between pregnancy distress and emotional self-disclosure subscales such as depression (r= -0.793), happiness (r= -0.121), jealousy (r= -0.13), anxiety (r= 0.317), relaxation (r= -0.224), fear (r= -0.518), and emotional self-regulation sub-scales such as prior-focused regulation strategies (r= -0.214) and response-focused regulation strategies (r= -0.317). Based on the results of multiple regression among emotional self-disclosure dimensions of depression, fear at the negative level of 0.01 and jealousy at the positive level of 0.05 could predict pregnancy distress. Further, prior-focused self-regulation strategies played a significant role in predicting pregnancy distress at the level of 0.05. Conclusion: According to the results, emotional self-discourse and self-regulation can predict pregnancy distress. The results can have a considerable effect to inform pregnant women about the effects of emotional self-disclosure and self-regulation skills on the pregnancy distress.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 40, "citationCount": 3, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Abediny2018PredictionOP,\n author = {Khadige Abediny and K.

While ample research has provided evidence for the mental and physical health benefits of writing (e.g., Pennebaker & Seagal, 1999), few studies have methodically examined the inner life of the fiction writer. This study explored two primary questions: (a) Why do authors write? and (b) How does the act of writing affect them in turn? This study employed Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) as a guiding methodology. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with five authors of fiction, then transcribed and analyzed to generate a rich interpretative account. The motivations for writing fiction were found to be complex and multifaceted and the impact often subtle, but profound. Authors both forget and find themselves in the task of writing. They temporarily leave behind their everyday lives as they become absorbed in the task of writing and transported into the worlds of their characters. Simultaneously, the author can access, utilize, and play with psychological and affective material. The authors described the act of entering into and conveying their characters\u2019 experiences as allowing them to name and make sense of their own experiences, gain greater understanding and empathy for others, and explore their own questions, identities, and beliefs. At times it also helps them gain greater acceptance and decreased sensitivity to more challenging emotions, memories, and relationships.

These benefits include improved psychological well-being, fewer health clinic visits, shorter hospital stays after surgery, and increased immune function. In athletes, high immune function is necessary to ward off illness during training and competition, but much research has shown that athletes tend to have lowered immune function. Therefore, writing about traumatic events may be a way for athletes to remain healthy during their seasons. To test this hypothesis, 21 varsity athletes and 15 individuals who exercised less than three hours per week participated in the current study. Saliva samples and reported psychological and physical health measures were taken before participants wrote in an online journal on four consecutive days. Saliva samples were taken again both one and three weeks after baseline, and reported health was measured again three weeks after baseline. It was expected that for those who wrote about traumatic events, both reported health and the secretory IgA content of the saliva would increase. The data showed that those who wrote about traumatic events experienced a decrease in negative affect, but not an increase in physical well-being. The immune data was not usable.

Brown, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Dept. of Social and Behavioral Health School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University Patients with cancer transitioning from completing their final cancer treatments to survivorship are particularly at risk for experiencing psychosocial stress, and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has referred to these cancer patients as \u201clost in transition.\u201d In this study, patients with cancer in their transition phase after completing their final radiation treatment were defined as cancer survivors (CS). CS must deal with chronic stressors such as the fear of cancer recurrence as well as the resumption of their roles in their family and work lives. Chronic stress impacts the nervous system and increases secretion of stress hormones (e.g. cortisol) from the endocrine system, which in turn influences immune function. These systems are particularly relevant for CS since research has shown associations between abnormal cortisol patterns and increased mortality in breast CS and immune dysfunction in CS can increase susceptibility to infections. The theoretical framework of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), which describes the interactions between the psychosocial, neuroendocrine and immune systems, guided the choice of outcomes for this study. The IOM has identified a lack of theory-driven interventions for managing psychosocial stress in CS. We reviewed the literature and identified two major types of PNI-based psychosocial interventions for cancer patients, namely cognitive-behavioral and complementary medical. One promising brief and inexpensive psychosocial intervention was expressive writing, which involved participants disclosing their deepest thoughts and feelings regarding their cancer in four 20-30 minute writing sessions over four consecutive days. We conducted a two-arm randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of an online expressive writing (EW) intervention delivered to CS who were 2-12 months post-radiation treatment completion. The results of this study revealed that EW was effective in regulating stress in our sample of CS over a period of six weeks as measured by lowered salivary cortisol levels and lowered self-reported fear of cancer recurrence. Online EW is a low-cost and convenient approach for delivering stress-management interventions for CS during survivorship. However, coordinated efforts are needed from health researchers, professionals and policy makers to define standardized approaches for testing psychosocial interventions and using PNI biomarkers to help develop evidence-based psychosocial cancer-care for CS during survivorship.", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 238, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Subnis2014StressMF,\n author = {U.

It is inspired by Rachman\u2019s (1980, 2001) formulation of emotional processing, and his subsequent proposals to explore the general mechanisms by which emotional disruptions are overcome. The specific rationale is informed by multilevel emotion theories, theories of post-traumatic stress disorder, and models of emotional processing. The research considered whether individuals who exhibit signs of a poor emotional processing style tend to encode events generally in a sensory-perceptual manner, with comparative deficits in their capacity to conceptually process data. Methodologically, the studies identify poor and effective emotional processors by using Baker et al.\u2019s (2009) emotional processing scale as a grouping measure. The studies explore differences between groups of poor and effective emotional processors\u2019 performance over a range of memory tasks drawn from episodic and autobiographical memory studies to detect evidence for a sensory- perceptual style of event and stimulus processing which is presumed to be indicated by a surfeit of perceptual details, heightened reported vividness, and a relative lack in conceptual ordering, narrative coherence and verbal indexing. Three general categories of memory are explored: memory for experimentally presented item lists, memory for extended narrative presentations and memory for naturally occurring events retained in long-term autobiographical memory representations. The evidence suggests a tendency to process in a sensory-perceptual manner amongst poor emotional processors for both experimental item lists, as well as in long term autobiographical memory investigations, whereas few differences between groups emerged for the study of narrative recollection. There was little evidence, by contrast, that effective emotional processors were superior at the conceptual processing of events or data. These results are discussed in terms of providing confirmation for information processing accounts of emotional disruptions and disorders which stress the aetiological significance in psychopathological conditions of how events are encoded, rendering such events accessible to broader autobiographical memory bases and conceptual elaboration. Furthermore, the importance of establishing more robust and testable definitions of conceptual processing is stressed.", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 381, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Howells2013EmotionalPA,\n author = {Glenys Howells},\n title = {Emotional processing and episodic memory.},\n year = {2013}\n}\n"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "121856175", "name": "Glenys Howells"}]}, {"paperId": "5024f84737f3d660f7253ddebc00dee7aa838351", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2336966035", "CorpusId": 147464780}, "corpusId": 147464780, "publicationVenue": null, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5024f84737f3d660f7253ddebc00dee7aa838351", "title": "Scope and Adequacy of Literature and Training Pertaining to Psychotherapy with Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Individuals", "abstract": null, "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 37, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Martino-Harms2013ScopeAA,\n author = {Justin W.

Because research on expressive writing (writing about important emotional experiences) has found such far-reaching therapeutic benefits, and attributes much of it to expressive writing\u2019s linguistic properties, exploring how a person\u2019s emotional understanding relates to language matters. Sixty-eight participants engaged in Pennebaker\u2019s expressive writing paradigm, and their word usage was measured on a number of categories, as given by the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program. Results indicated that different levels of emotional intelligence and alexithymia correlated with certain parameters of word usage. However, few relationships were observed between the two attributes and change in word usage over time. WORD USAGE AND EXPRESSIVE WRITING 3 It has been well established that expressing one\u2019s emotions verbally, such as in writing, can be beneficial in myriad ways (Pennebaker, 1997). This has implications for therapy and healing from trauma. In particular, it is believed that the way a person writes about emotions can influence the extent to which this emotional disclosure is beneficial (Pennebaker & Seagal, 1999). This poses a potential problem for some, though, because the way an individual writes may be affected by the personality of that individual (Pennebaker, Mehl, & Niederhoffer, 2003). Of specific interest in the present study are those who have different levels of emotional understanding. Do people who have low levels of emotional understanding verbalize their emotions differently than those with high understanding? If so, what is the nature of this difference and how does it affect their writing and its benefits? Expressive Writing The term \u201cexpressive writing\u201d refers to disclosure of emotions and emotional experiences in written form (Pennebaker, 1997). In the past 25 years, researchers have explored the benefits, the bounds, the moderators, and more about expressive writing. The typical method (originally from Pennebaker & Beall, 1986) that these studies follow involves writing about an important emotional event or trauma for 15 to 30 minutes a day for three to five days. Participants are asked to \u201creally let go\u201d and describe their deepest feelings. As a control, another group of individuals write about superficial, non-emotional subjects. Using this paradigm, investigators can discover the effects of expressive writing. WORD USAGE AND EXPRESSIVE WRITING 4 The beneficial effects from this exercise have been shown to be wide-ranging. On the physiological level, expressive writing has been found to be associated with a decrease in physician visits (Cameron & Nicholls, 1998; Francis & Pennebaker, 1992; Greenberg & Stone, 1992; Pennebaker, Barger, & Tiebout, 1989; Pennebaker & Francis, 1996) and better antibody response to a virus (Esterling, Antoni, Fletcher, Margulies, & Schneiderman, 1994). Behaviorally, research has shown expressive writing to lead to faster reemployment time for unemployed individuals (Spera, Buhrfeind, & Pennebaker, 1994), better attendance at work (Francis & Pennebaker, 1992), higher GPA in students (Cameron & Nicholls, 1996; Pennebaker & Francis, 1996), more working memory capacity (Klein & Boals, 2001), and better transition to college for recent high school graduates (Francis & Pennebaker, 1996). The results also extend to psychological wellbeing, like a decrease in depressive symptoms (Gortner, Rude, & Pennebaker, 1999; Greenberg & Stone, 1992; Spera et al, 1994). Other studies have explored the extent or bounds of expressive writing\u2019s effectiveness. Burton and King (2008) found that even writing for two minutes on two days could elicit some of these effects, while Chung and Pennebaker (2008) found that writing for one hour in a single sitting had effects but not significantly more than was found for shorter writing stints. In another study specifying expressive writing\u2019s extent of effectiveness, Burton and King (2004) found that the valence of topic may not matter for beneficial results. In addition, a number of studies have also focused on how individual differences may either moderate or augment the effects of expressive writing, such as gender, age, or personality (Christiansen et al, 1996; Pennebaker, 1997), though few have shown consistent trends. WORD USAGE AND EXPRESSIVE WRITING 5 Why is Writing Effective? It is of interest, then, to determine the underlying processes in expressive writing that make it work so effectively. Though investigators posit different ideas, there is no completely conclusive theory, and some doubt that there is a single theory to account for all of the benefits (Smyth & Pennebaker, 2008). Originally, a model of inhibition and confrontation was adopted to explain the effectiveness of expressive writing (Pennebaker, 1989). This explanation described inhibition of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as a physically stressful activity\u2014as an activity that involves conscious and deliberate selfrestraint. Over time, this stress builds up and may lead to detriments in psychological or physical health. It also keeps one from fully analyzing the event or experience that he or she is suppressing. Therefore, confronting one\u2019s emotions within expressive writing works to reverse and release this build-up. When people actively think about and process their emotions as opposed to inhibit them\u2014what purportedly occurs during expressive writing\u2014they reduce the weight of physical stress and are able to better understand their emotions (Pennebaker, 1989). Essentially, Pennebaker theorized that the positive outcome effects from expressive writing were a repercussion of catharsis\u2014that the inhibition of emotional expression is stressful, and venting can reduce that stress and lead to improved health. This model of emotional disclosure found support in previous theories in psychoanalysis, cognitive psychology, and psychophysiology (Pennebaker, 1989). However, more recent research leads one to believe that it has more to do with the power of language and of verbalizing one\u2019s emotions (Danoff-Burg, Mosher, Seawall, & WORD USAGE AND EXPRESSIVE WRITING 6 Agee, 2010; Pennebaker & Francis, 1996; Pennebaker, Mayne, & Francis, 1997; Pennebaker & Seagal, 1999; Smyth, True, & Suoto, 2001). Investigators speculate that writing down or talking out emotional issues allows a person to give the issue more structure through words, and this structure may lead individuals to find their emotional experiences easier to understand and process (Gon\u00e7alves, 1995). Furthermore, in creating a coherent narrative out of one\u2019s emotional experiences, individuals may be able to manage their emotions more effectively, thus producing the mental and physical improvements (Pennebaker & Seagal, 1999). Studies have also shown that expressive writing essays that contain a more logical and structured narrative lead to more benefits in the writer (Smyth, True, & Suoto, 2001; Danoff-Burg et al, 2010). This finding bolsters the idea that the structure of language and narrative is the underlying source of benefit in expressive writing. Two pieces are involved: that emotions can often be messy and unordered, and that we as humans seek stories and narratives to explain our world (Pennebaker & Seagal, 1999). The conventions of language and writing, then, offer an order to the sometimes irrational nature of emotional experience, resulting in better management of both one\u2019s emotions and the stresses that can come from them. Specifics of Word Usage and Language Following from the theory that verbalizing emotions leads to health improvement, a number of studies have attempted to specify how certain words or structures may influence the benefits of expressive writing (Campbell & Pennebaker, 2003; Lakoff, 1975; Pennebaker, 1993; Pennebaker & Francis, 1996; Pennebaker & Graybeal, 2001; Pennebaker, Mayne, & Francis, 1997; Petrie, Booth, & Pennebaker, 1998; Wientraub, WORD USAGE AND EXPRESSIVE WRITING 7 1981). If creating a narrative is the eventual \u201cgoal\u201d for expressive writing as a treatment, how do people create it with the words available to them? It turns out that the answer to this question is linked to individual differences. That the way people write, talk, and communicate is a function of their personality is not a new discovery, and possibly a statement of common sense. Pennebaker and King (1999) established reasonable evidence that individuals\u2019 writing or linguistic styles remain relatively stable over time and in different situations; thus, even elements of writing like word choice, tense, and point of view could reflect consistent aspects of personality. However, the study of specific word usage is relatively new. One example is Lakoff\u2019s (1975) study, which showed that women swear less than men, use more intensifiers like \u201creally\u201d and \u201cso,\u201d and use more words reflecting uncertainty like \u201csort of\u201d and \u201cmaybe\u201d than men\u2014perhaps due to cultural expectations linked with gender. Another example is that of Weintraub (1981), who found that individuals with depression used the word \u201cI\u201d significantly more than those without depression. These studies exhibit how language can reveal not just stable parts of our personalities but also mirror more time-sensitive states of mind or stages in our lives. The following are several models that investigators have developed over a number of studies to account for effects of specific word usage. For instance, investigators have attempted to formulate a model based on emotion words. Initially, Pennebaker (1993) found that individuals who used a high number of negative emotion words (such as \u201chate\u201d and \u201ccry\u201d) and a low number of positive emotion words (such as \u201cglad\u201d and \u201ccherish\u201d) showed the most benefit from writing about personal traumas. Pennebaker and Francis (1996), however, found no support for this claim; ra", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 64, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Pluth2012AlexithymiaEI,\n author = {Kathleen Pluth},\n title = {Alexithymia, Emotional Intelligence, and Their Relation to Word Usage in Expressive Writing},\n year = {2012}\n}\n"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "112924259", "name": "Kathleen Pluth"}]}, {"paperId": "f05e9cdc1f2890ae0893f2fc3fd3813db0c2b8a1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "163132754", "CorpusId": 54978905}, "corpusId": 54978905, "publicationVenue": null, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f05e9cdc1f2890ae0893f2fc3fd3813db0c2b8a1", "title": "Losing one's spouse, Transformation of the self and the role of writing/Locked in - Daring to break free", "abstract": "This thesis comprises two components: a dissertation and a memoir. The dissertation focuses on the role of writing in relation to the experience of traumatic loss. It argues that expressive writing is a powerful tool to resolve grief following such loss. The thesis investigates how narrative and writing assist in the resolution of grief. It contributes to research through a narrative analysis of the memoir \"To have and to hold\" (1997). The analysis examines the text's representations of Walter Mikac's shattered sense of self and worldview, following the loss of his wife and daughters in Australia's worst mass shooting in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996. The dissertation examines how the narrative facilitates the re-building of coherence in Mikac's life through memory, reflection, and finding meaning; and it analyses the text's narrative structure in relation to the healing benefits of writing. \n \nThe second component of the thesis is a work of creative non-fiction. The submitted section, Locked in \u2013 Breaking Free, is the beginning of my memoir, which depicts the illness and death of my husband Mark at the age of 42 in 2004. The submitted section is approximately 15,500 words long. The section will be followed (in the final memoir) by chapters which will discuss Mark's eight-month illness, his death, my identity crisis as a widow and single mother, my transformation, personal growth and the rebuilding of my family life, and the difficulty of re-living Mark's illness and death in a medical negligence court case. I have found meaning in Mark's death by becoming a palliative care spokesperson and in bearing witness by writing the memoir. The section submitted gives a detailed description of Mark\u201fs sudden illness, the unfolding of his treatment, and the alternating hope and devastation. The memoir includes flashbacks to the beginnings of our early life together. The title refers to the fact that Mark was locked in his body, unable to move or speak, and to my own \"breaking free\" in terms of the rebuilding of my life, family and self.", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 57, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Elzen2012LosingOS,\n author = {Katrin Den Elzen},\n title = {Losing one's spouse, Transformation of the self and the role of writing/Locked in - Daring to break free},\n year = {2012}\n}\n"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "116384742", "name": "Katrin Den Elzen"}]}, {"paperId": "071af52387b6cf10f15bd900c6cbe8b0a0fdbead", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2556475179", "CorpusId": 29716545}, "corpusId": 29716545, "publicationVenue": null, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/071af52387b6cf10f15bd900c6cbe8b0a0fdbead", "title": "An Exploratory Study Utilizing Expressive Writing and a Novel Cognitive Tool as Strategies for Enhanced Moral Perception", "abstract": "The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the impact of a decision-making \u201ctool\u201d and an expressive writing task on moral perception, utilizing an ethical vignette.

It was found that characteristics of narratives have a positive relation to well-being and can help to improve it. Based on this relation, different interventions were developed to improve well-being. Today is only partly known which specific elements in such interventions lead to high well-being. It is assumed that a combination of elements is responsible for the positive effect on well-being. Until now, established theories failed to explain the whole working mechanism. Maybe due to the fact that they primarily tried to answer the question from a theoretical point of view. Therefore, the current study is concerned with the participants\u2019 view on two interventions: \u201cExpressive Writing\u201d and \u201cThe Stories we Live by\u201d. The study focuses on how participants experienced the interventions and what are differences in the experience between the interventions. Participants (N=89) were randomly assigned to one of the interventions and were afterwards asked which elements they experienced as helpful and important. The so gained data was analyzed by the grounded theory approach. The developed theoretical model states reciprocal relationships between the most elements, implying that the whole interventions were experienced as important and helpful from most participants. Furthermore, it was found that participants mentioned the elements self-knowledge, reminiscence, writing, coping strategies and specific elements such as particular tasks most often. Only few differences between the interventions could be shown, implying that the experiences in the interventions were almost similar. Obvious was that in the \u201cExpressive Writing\u201d intervention the element writing was mentioned most often. Contrary, in \u201cThe Stories we Live by\u201d self-knowledge was mentioned the most and reminiscence was mentioned more often than writing. This shows that the main differences between the interventions could be found in the methodology, namely between the elements writing and reminiscence. Further research is needed to test the developed theoretical model and specify the relationships between the elements. For future interventions can be suggested not to use individual elements, instead using the interventions as a whole and integrate at least the elements participants mentioned most often as valuable.", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 49, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{M\u00fcller2012AQC,\n author = {Alicia M\u00fcller and M.

Participants were asked the same memory cue: \"Tell me about the day you were accepted to the University,\" and narratives were obtained either through oral or written collection. Each participant (n=246: men=62, women=184) was given a demographic sheet and the 40-item Extended Personal Attributes Questionnaire (EPAQ), which measured each participant's masculine and feminine traits regarding the self, and categorized each participant into either masculine, feminine, androgynous, or undifferentiated gender identity (Spence, Helmreich, & Holahan, 1979). Narratives were coded for theme (socialization), structure (detail), and content (emotionality) using a scheme adapted from Buckner and Fivush (1998). The present study employed a 2 x 4 mixed method research design with memory recall mode as a between subjects factor and gender identity as the within subjects factor. A two-way ANOV A was conducted. Participants, who identified as feminine and undifferentiated expressed significantly more negative emotions in the written versus oral mode. In addition, a main effect was found whereby participants expressed higher amounts of positive emotion as well as overall emotion in the oral (recorded) recall mode versus written memory recall mode. These findings are in line with previous research (e.g., Esterling, 1994) which revealed that sharing a memory verbally aroused more positive affect within participants when compared to written expressions. Recent research (Wong, Pituch & Rochlen, 2006) also suggests that feminine-typed persons may link higher emotional expression to social approval and have more practice/knowledge with expressing one's emotions. Masculine-typed individuals may be less likely to express these forms of emotions due to societal pressures and expectations.

Health (2010) 17 : 135-152 The relationship emotion and health has been a focus of scientific inquiry in psychology for a long time but it occupied pivotal position with the advent of Alexander\u2019s psychosomatic paradigm. Since then, a number of affect related constructs have been explicated with potential implications for health. The present paper makes an attempt to review the role of some affect related constructs in health that have been centre of attention in the contemporary psychological researches. We have reviewed empirical evidences that demonstrate the relationship of such affect related constructs, as emotion regulation, emotional disclosure, emotional intelligence, alexithymia, positive/negative affect, and affect intensity with health. In general, the review suggests that some affect related constructs such as cognitive regulations of emotion, emotional disclosure, positive emotional experiences and most of the dimensions of emotional intelligence have a beneficial influence on the health status of an individual. On the other hand, such affect related variables as effortful suppression of emotions, alexithymia, affect intensity, and negative emotional experiences have adverse consequences for health. As far as the role of valence and magnitude of emotional experience is concerned, the existing literature suggests that high intensity of experienced emotion has an adverse effect on health irrespective of the emotional valence. The potential mediating mechanisms linking various affect related dimensions to health have also been reviewed. Future research, however, is needed to develop an integrated holistic theory of health based on affect related variables. Emotion-heath relationship occupies a pivotal position in the area of health psychology in general and psychosomatic/behavioural medicine in particular. However, the hypothesis that the nature of emotional experience and expression may be an important determinant of one\u2019s health status gained popularity in scientific psychology with the advent of psychosomatic paradigm (Alexander, 1939) of health and illness. Within the psychosomatic paradigm, attempt to suppress negative emotions is the central element leading to the development and progression of various physical illnesses (Alexander, 1939, Alexander and French, 1946; Dunbar, 1954). After few decades of the Alexander\u2019s psychosomatic paradigm, Sifneos (1972) introduced the construct of alexithymia (the core feature is the difficulty in identifying and communicating emotions and feelings) that emerged as an alternative paradigm for linking emotion with health (see Taylor, 1984, 1994 for a review). The continuing efforts of psychologists to link emotion and health lead to the identification of several other affect related constructs that can explain a significant proportion of variance in the health status of an individual. For example, the affective disposition to experience positive and negative emotions (hereafter referred to as positive and negative affectivity), the disposition to experience extremes of emotional states irrespective of the emotional valence (hereafter revered to as affect intensity) have been identified as important predictors of health. Similarly, the ability to control or regulate the experience and expression of emotions (emotion regulation), the tendency to socially share and verbally express traumatic emotional experiences (emotional disclosure), and the ability to perceive, express, understand, monitor and manage emotions (emotional intelligence) are certain other affect related variables that might influence the health status of an individual. In this paper, we have attempted to present an overview of the findings related to the role of the said affect related variables in health and illness.", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 148, "citationCount": 28, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Pandey2010EmotionAH,\n author = {R.

Ziadni Jacqueline D. Kloss, Ph.D. Written emotional expression has garnered significant evidence as a therapeutic tool for the processing of traumatic life events (Frattaroli, 2006; Pennebaker, 1997). However, its underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood or clearly defined. In this study, we predicted that written emotional expression exercises could serve as a mindfulness process. The goals of this study were (a) to test whether the writing process enhances mindfulness levels and (b) whether we can enhance mindfulness levels by building on a traditional writing instruction. To pilot this exercise, we modified the instructions of the traditional writing exercise to instruct individuals how to exercise mindfulness in their writing. Participants (N = 40) were randofmly assigned to either the traditional-writing group (TG) based on the Pennebaker instructions (Pennebaker, Kiecolt-Glaser, & Glaser, 1988) or to the mindfulnessenhanced group (MG), which incorporated mindfulness-based instructions (Levitt et al., 2004; Hayes & Smith, 2005) for writing about students\u2019 most stressful life experience. The Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS) was used to measure reports of curiosity and decentering before and after the writing exercise. Results revealed that decentering increased after participants engaged in the traditional writing exercise but not the mindfulness-enhanced exercise. Contrary to our prediction, curiosity reports did not change significantly overtime, and the mindfulness-enhanced writing did not differentially enhance individuals\u2019 mindfulness levels compared to the traditional writing exercise. These findings provide preliminary evidence that decentering may serve as an underlying mechanism in expressive writing. Future studies should replicate these findings and assess mindfulness changes in expressive writing over the course of several days.", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 106, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Ziadni2010EnhancingMI,\n author = {M.

Disclosing emotional reactions to stressful and traumatic experiences through writing has been shown to have beneficial effects on psychological well-being in healthy students and clinical populations (Frattaroli, 2006; Smyth, 1998). The principal aim of this thesis was to examine the efficacy of a written emotional disclosure intervention for individuals with infertility. However, initially the potential moderating effects of delivering the intervention via a computer and within the context of the home was examined. This showed that the adaptation of the traditional laboratory based, handwritten intervention developed by Pennebaker and Beall (1986) did not impact on the short-term or longer-term effects of written emotional disclosure. Subsequently, following a study which failed to recruit participants from an assisted conception unit, a written emotional disclosure intervention for individuals with infertility was examined using an internet-mediated delivery. Results showed that the effectiveness of writing about the experience of infertility and infertility treatment in producing changes in psychological well-being at 4-week follow-up was related to changes in the content of the disclosure narratives across the writing sessions. Analysis revealed that for those individuals in the disclosure group who showed an increase in their use of negative emotion words and cognitive words in their writing over the three disclosure sessions was associated with a reduction in symptoms of psychological distress. The findings of this study are discussed in relation to the heterogeneity of the sample and possible impact of the recruitment methods used. The contribution of this thesis has been to directly test the potential moderating effects of methodological variation in intervention delivery and examine the utility of a written emotional disclosure intervention for individuals with infertility, in doing so the findings of this thesis contribute to the expanding literature.

Dickinson Recently, 44% of college students reported increased levels of stress, and 28% reported feeling overwhelmed (e.g., The American College Health Association: 2004). Stress has been linked to a variety of physical and emotional problems (e.g., Matheny & McCarthy, 2000). A number of studies (e.g., Matheny et al., 1993; Matheny et al., 1986) have identified coping resources as helpful in decreasing the negative effects of stress. However, there are still some questions in the literature regarding effective ways to increase coping resources. Reading written feedback about coping resources is one way to increase individuals\u2019 awareness about their coping resources (e.g., Matheny et al., 1993). Another intervention that has been shown to have positive and lasting effects with regard to health and well being is therapeutic writing (e.g. Smyth, 1998). While there are studies that point toward writing being beneficial to coping, there are currently no studies that have specifically connected writing interventions with increased coping resources. The purpose of this study was to determine if individuals could increase coping resources and life satisfaction, as well as decrease perceptions of stress and depression by reading about their coping resources and/or writing about them. One hundred and four college students were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three conditions. Condition one was the control condition (i.e. no treatment), condition two received and read written feedback about their current coping resources, and condition three received written feedback about their current coping resources, and wrote about them at three different times. All students were given the following measures at the beginning and end of the study to assess for changes in their perceptions of stress and coping, as well as depression and satisfaction with life: the Coping Resources Inventory for Stress (Matheny, Curlette, Aycock, Pugh, & Taylor, 1992), the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Satisfaction with Life scale (Diener, Emmons, Larasen, & Griffen, 1985). The results showed that reading written feedback about coping resources positively and significantly affected the overall coping level of females. However, their satisfaction with life, perception of stress, and depression levels remained unchanged. For males, reading written feedback did not significantly change their overall coping resources or any of the other variables. Writing about stress and coping did not significantly benefit males or females on any variable. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

In Study 1, the strength of relationship between negative life events and distress varied across three latent classes, reflecting vulnerable, average, and resilient profiles. Graduated EI scores, in terms of emotional self-awareness, ability to express, and self-manage emotions, predicted membership to each class. Across the 414 survey respondents, these three EI abilities appeared to augment psychological resilience in the aftermath of negative life events. In Study 2, all six EI abilities were found to be weakly associated with dyadic adjustment, and moderately associated with eight relationship enhancing communication behaviours. The eight behaviours were themselves moderately to very strongly associated with adjustment. Mediation analyses revealed that each EI ability influenced dyadic adjustment through the communication behaviours it best predicted. Across the 116 romantic partners surveyed, those better able to express and self-manage emotion communicated in the most relationship enhancing ways. In Study 3, four of the six EI abilities were found to be differentially important in the prediction of seven Adaptive Performance dimensions, five Conflict Management strategies, three forms of Organizational Commitment, and seven Achievement Motivations. The abilities to think clearly under pressure, identify others\u2019 emotions, self-manage emotions, and manage others\u2019 emotions made valuable contributions, while emotional self-awareness, and the ability to express emotion, did", "venue": "", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": 426, "citationCount": 6, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Armstrong2007WhyEM,\n author = {A.

These benefits include improved psychological well-being, fewer health clinic visits, shorter hospital stays after surgery, and increased immune function. In athletes, high immune function is necessary to ward off illness during training and competition, but much research has shown that athletes tend to have lowered immune function. Therefore, writing about traumatic events may be a way for athletes to remain healthy during their seasons. To test this hypothesis, 21 varsity athletes and 15 individuals who exercised less than three hours per week participated in the current study. Saliva samples and reported psychological and physical health measures were taken before participants wrote in an online journal on four consecutive days. Saliva samples were taken again both one and three weeks after baseline, and reported health was measured again three weeks after baseline. It was expected that for those who wrote about traumatic events, both reported health and the secretory IgA content of the saliva would increase. The data showed that those who wrote about traumatic events experienced a decrease in negative affect, but not an increase in physical well-being. The immune data was not usable.

The acquisition of reflexive social emotions: The transmission and reproduction of social control through joint ac-Questions concerning whether it is best to express or suppress felt emotions have long been of interest to psychologists. Is expressing pride in one's accomplishments a good thing? It does allow others to celebrate one's accomplishments, but it can lead to one being judged as arrogant. Are fears best confided to others or should they be suppressed? Expressing fears may elicit help and comfort or derision and exploitation. What will happen if one expresses sadness? Will companions express compassion and reassurance or pity and avoidance? Most generally, is expressing one's emotions good or bad for your personal well-being? Our answer to all of these questions is, \"It depends.\" To the extent that emotions carry information about one's needs, we argue, the wisdom of expressing them to others depends importantly, even crucially, on the relationship context within which one finds oneself. Our position is simple: Expressing emotion is likely to be beneficial in the company of others who care about one's welfare. The more companions care, the wiser expression of emotion is likely to be. Such expressions are more likely to be accepted, elicit care, and maintain or strengthen the caring relationship. In sharp contrast, if one finds oneself with companions who do not care about one's welfare, it is generally unwise to express emotions indicative of one's needs. At best, the expressions will be ignored; at worst, one may be avoided, derided, or exploited. In tlus chapter, we review evidence supporting these claims. First, we make a theoretical case that expressing emotions-such as fear, sadness, happiness, and pride-is less risky and more beneficial in communal relationships (in which partners assume responsibility for one's welfare and provide benefits noncontingently) than in other relationships. Second, we review empirical evidence that, indeed, emotions are more often expressed when people perceive their partner to have a communal relationshp with them than when they do not hold this perception. Third, we make a theoretical and empirical case that expressing emotion in communal contexts", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 80, "citationCount": 41, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Clark2004TheSL,\n author = {M.

A number of hypotheses have been suggested to account for these beneficial effects, but the precise mechanism of action underlying expressive writing has yet to be established. Positive outcomes obtained in studies with clinical populations, have led to the question of whether expressive writing could be helpful for people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). This study aimed to pilot an expressive writing intervention for people with CFS and to explore their experience of the intervention. It aimed to investigate the feasibility, acceptability and perceived helpfulness of the intervention, and attempted to shed light on its possible mechanism of action. Nine patients were recruited from a specialist CFS clinic. They were asked to write about an emotionally upsetting or traumatic experience, for twenty minutes, once a week, for four consecutive weeks. Following the expressive writing intervention, they participated in a semi-structured interview to explore their experience. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to analyse the transcribed interviews. Expressive writing was found to be both feasible and acceptable to the people with CFS in this study. Participants reported that overall the home-based writing intervention had been helpful and had provided them with a possible coping strategy for the future. They articulated how they thought the writing had made a difference and from this three possible mechanisms of action were proposed, including emotional expression, behavioural activation and cognitive organisation.

Despite the fact that it reactivates the emotions associated with the experience, people are prone to talk about the negative events they face. So, why do people share their emotions? From an intrapersonal perspective, a widespread belief exists that verbalising an emotion alleviates the impact of an emotional event. The purpose of our research was to examine whether verbalisation of emotions effectively contributed to the recovery from the emotion. We review the correlative and experimental studies that were conducted to test this hypothesis. They consistently failed to support the view that mere talking about an emotional memory can lower its emotional load. Nevertheless, participants generally reported that they perceived the sharing process as beneficial. The question then remains as to why people share their emotions and report it is a beneficial process, if it does not bring emotional recovery. To answer this question, we shifted perspective and studied the interpersonal factors implied in the social sharing process. In the following of the chapter, we suggest that the effects of social sharing depend on the social context in which it occurs. We first consider types of sharing partners that are commonly chosen both as a function of age and according to the type of emotional situation experienced. Then, the types of helpful responses from sharing partners are examined. Finally, recent studies on the effects of specific sharing partner\u2019s reactions on affiliation and cognitive benefits are presented. In the conclusion of this chapter, implications of the research on social sharing for the field of emotion regulation are considered.", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 86, "citationCount": 43, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Zech2004SocialSO,\n author = {E.

Following assessment of baseline medical history, mood state, stress, cortisol, sleep, alcohol use, and exercise training, collegiate rowers were stratified by gender and competitive level and randomly assigned to either a control group or a CBSM group. Exercise training information and psychosocial assessments were repeated immediately following the intervention period, and health care providers who were blinded to participant assignment recorded the frequency of medical visits and the number of days injured or ill until the end of the season. Athletes randomly assigned to a CBSM group experienced significant reductions in the number of illness and injury days as compared to control group athletes.

One aspect of this study was to investigate the discrepancy hypothesis proposing that specific emotional coping styles elicit patterns of discrepant self-report and physiological responses. The major focus of the study tested whether matching therapeutic writing tasks to specific emotional coping styles would significantly decrease stress and somatic symptoms, and whether mismatching such writing tasks to emotional coping styles would not decrease stress and somatic symptoms. Undergraduate students were identified as having an emotional coping style of either expression or repression. Within each expressor and repressor group, participants were randomly assigned to 'profound' or 'distractor' writing tasks. This served to both match and mismatch writing tasks to emotional coping styles. Pre-test and post-test measures of stress and somatic symptoms determined the effects of a two week writing intervention period. Data was analysed through a series of 2 x 2 x 2 (Time x Emotion Group x Intervention) split plot analysis of variance (SP ANOV A) tests. The pattern of results did not support the discrepancy hypothesis, as repressors were slightly higher on all measures than expressors. Results of the matching hypothesis revealed reductions in stress over time that were not related to the writing tasks. Findings suggested influences of the Hawthorne effect and a placebo effect, whereby empathic acknowledgement and self-disclosure of a senior peer may have led to cognitive and emotional reappraisal, thereby leading to changes in stress related behaviour. Possible avenues for future research and cost effective interventions for universities are discussed. Author : Pamela D.

Circulating lymphocytes and T lymphocyte subsets (CD4 (helper), CD8 (cytotoxic/suppressor)) as well as a variety of standard hematological markers were measured following the writing intervention and compared with baseline values. In two separate studies (N=40 and N=38), there were reproducible significant differences between the emotional disclosure and control writing groups immediately following the intervention in CD4, CD8 and total circulating lymphocyte numbers but not in CD4/CD8 ratios or any other hematological variables. Circulating lymphocyte numbers in the emotional writing group stayed relatively constant over the time-course of the studies, suggesting that the difference between the groups was due to a transient elevation in postwriting blood lymphocyte numbers in the control group. Self-evaluations immediately before and after each writing session confirmed that the intervention was stressful for subjects in the emotional disclosure group but the effects on circulating lymphocytes were not attributable purely to anxiety-related factors. The results extend our previous observation of changes in immune reactivity following a writing intervention and indicate that the group differences are the result of fluctuations over time in the control group but relative stability in the emotional disclosure group.

The Department of Defense (DoD) has virtually abandoned its past arguments that homosexual men and women are psychologically impaired, a security risk, or incapable of performing their duties, and therefore are inherently unfit for military service (Herek, 1993). Instead, the DoD now concedes that lesbians and gay men can serve honorably and capably, and acknowledges that they have done so in the past. Indeed, the current policy (\u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell, Don\u2019t Pursue\u201d) allows service by gay people provided that they keep their sexual orientation a secret. Thus, current policy is less about homosexuality than it is about heterosexuals\u2019 reactions to homosexuality and to persons who are gay or lesbian. The DoD argues that heterosexual personnel would be unwilling to work with or obey orders from a gay man or lesbian, that they would be unwilling to share sleeping quarters or latrines with them, and that the presence in a unit of an individual known to be gay would reduce cohesion and thereby impair performance (for elaboration on these points, see the chapters by MacCoun and Shawver).

First, it provides psychologically and biologically plausible explanations for how psychological factors might influence immunity and immune system-mediated disease. Second, it covers substantial evidence that factors such as stress, negative affect, clinical depression, social support, and repression/denial can influence both cellular and humoral indicators of immune status and function. Third, at least in the case of the less serious infectious diseases (colds, influenza, herpes), it considers consistent and convincing evidence of links between stress and negative affect and disease onset and progression. Although still early in its development, research also suggests a role of psychological factors in autoimmune diseases. Evidence for effects of stress, depression, and repression/denial on onset and progression of AIDs and cancer is less consistent and inconclusive, possibly owing to methodological limitations inherent in studying these complex illnesses, or because psychological influences on immunity are not of the magnitude or type necessary to alter the body's response in these cases.

After accounting for potential immunomodulatory confounds, we found that HIV\u20101 seropositive men had higher EBV\u2010VCA antibody titers than those diagnosed as seronegative at every time point during the study; however, no significant differences were found with respect to HHV\u20106.

Eighty first\u2010year undergraduates completed a personality inventory and were asked to write an essay/letter for 30 minutes about a stressful event that had happened in their life. Blood was collected from each subject immediately after writing. Essays were scored for degree of emotional disclosure according to the ratio of emotional\u2010to\u2010total words used. Degree of disclosure was found to be associated with impaired control of latent EBV (high antibody titers to the EBV\u2010VCA) controlling for medication use, recent sleep loss, physical activity, lean body mass, caloric intake, and alcohol and recreational drug use. Further, individual differences in interpersonal style (characterized by emotional suppression) related to this immunologic marker in a similar fashion, and these two factors interacted in determining EBV\u2010VCA titers. That is, Repressors who were either high or low disclosers had high levels of antibody titer to EBV\u2010VCA, whereas only those Sensitizers who did not disclose had high antibody titers to EBV\u2010VCA. In addition to supporting the hypothesis that emotional repression is associated with some aspects of host\u2010virus interaction, the present findings highlight the importance of obtaining behavioral and psychometric assessments in psychoimmunologic investigations of this abstract affective construct (i.e., repression).", "venue": "Psychosomatic Medicine", "year": 1990, "referenceCount": 42, "citationCount": 194, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "1990-07-01", "journal": {"volume": "52", "pages": "397\u2013410", "name": "Psychosomatic Medicine"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Esterling1990EmotionalRS,\n author = {B.

Forty\u2010six asymptomatic homosexual men between the ages of 18 and 40 yrs were recruited from a gay men's organization and through advertisements in a local newspaper. Measures of cell\u2010mediated immunity (lymphocyte phenotypic markers, mitogen responsivity, and natural killer cell cytotoxicity) and psychological functioning (state anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and avoidant behaviors) were obtained at baseline, five weeks later and 72 hr before serostatus notification, and 1 week, 3 weeks and 5 weeks postnotification. Results suggested a dissociation between psychological and immunological phenomena among seropositives wherein lymphocyte proliferative responses to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) remained unchanged in the face of significant increases in state anxiety and intrusive thoughts following serostatus notification. These findings suggested that asymptomatic HIV\u20101 infected individuals, even at the earliest stages of infection, may be unable to mount an immune response to potent psychosocial stressors (i.e., serostatus notification), due perhaps, to the fact that the viral contribution to immune functioning overrides any influence of environmental stimuli. Among the seronegative subjects studied, blastogenic responses to PHA and PWM were depressed at baseline (relative to a group of age and gender\u2010matched controls who were not undergoing HIV\u20101 antibody testing) but PHA values returned to normal values 5 weeks later. Natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and CD4+CD45R+ inducer cell counts appeared to parallel these changes in seronegatives. Seropositives did display fluctuations in NK cell cytotoxicity that were similar to those noted for seronegatives. Correlational analyses suggested that individual differences in anxiety responses at the time of notification of seropositivity predicted subsequent (1\u2010week lag) declines in NK cell cytotoxicity but not other functional markers. Although most seropositives displayed clinical levels of anxiety, intrusive thoughts and avoidant responses during the week of serostatus notification, these measures returned to their initial nonclinical baseline levels within 5 weeks after notification in both the seropositive and seronegative groups.", "venue": "Psychosomatic Medicine", "year": 1990, "referenceCount": 43, "citationCount": 129, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "1990-05-01", "journal": {"volume": "52", "pages": "247\u2013270", "name": "Psychosomatic Medicine"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Ironson1990ChangesII,\n author = {G.

A general model of psychosomatics assumes that inhibiting or holding back one's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors is associated with long-term stress and disease. Actively confronting upsetting experiences--through writing or talking-is hypothesized to reduce the negative effects of inhibition. Fifty healthy undergraduates were assigned to write about either traumatic experiences or superficial topics for 4 consecutive days. Two measures of cellular immune-system function and health center visits suggested that confronting traumatic experiences was physically beneficial. The implications for psychotherapy as a preventive treatment for health problems are discussed. There is little doubt that psychotherapy reduces subjective distress and yields positive behavioral outcomes. In recent years, a small group of researchers has sought to learn whether psychotherapy can also reduce health problems. Two promising reviews have indicated that the use of mental health services is associated with fewer medical visits, fewer days of hospitalization, and lower overall medical costs. In a summary of 15 studies published between 1965 and 1980, Mumford, Schlesinger, and Glass (1981) found that individuals who underwent psychotherapy evidenced a 13% decrease in medical utilization relative to nonpsychotherapy control subjects. Similarly, in a review of 13 studies of mental health services that were introduced into organizations, Jones and Vischi (1980) found that psychotherapy was associated with a 20% drop in medical utilization.", "venue": "Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology", "year": 1988, "referenceCount": 34, "citationCount": 1257, "influentialCitationCount": 36, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "ClinicalTrial", "Review"], "publicationDate": "1988-04-01", "journal": {"volume": "56 2", "pages": "\n          239-45\n        ", "name": "Journal of consulting and clinical psychology"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Pennebaker1988DisclosureOT,\n author = {J.

Skin conductance, blood pressure, and heart rate were continuously measured. Based on judges' ratings of subjects' depth of disclosure, subjects were classified as high or low disclosers. Talking about traumatic events was associated with decreased behavioral inhibition, as measured by lower skin conductance levels among high disclosers. Disclosing traumatic material was also associated with increased cardiovascular activity. In Experiment 2, subjects both talked aloud and thought about a traumatic event and about plans for the day. Half of the subjects were alone in an experimental cubicle and talked into a tape recorder; the remaining subjects talked to a silent \"confessor\" who sat behind a curtain. Among high disclosers, both talking and thinking about traumatic events produced lower skin conductance levels than did thinking or talking about plans for the day.

Regression and natural killer (NK)\u2010cell activities were compared for patients and their mothers from five families with X\u2010linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP) and three control groups. Seven of the 10 patients with XLP exhibited weak T\u2010cell activity against autologous EBV\u2010infected lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) comparable to EBV\u2010seronegative controls. In contrast, 8 of 10 obligate carrier females of XLP had unusually strong activity, which was comparable to anti\u2010early\u2010antigen (EA) positive controls.

To reconcile the unlimited growth potential in vitro with the maintenance of a low proportion of B-cells infected by EBV in vivo, a strict in vivo control mechanism has to be postulated. Certain aspects of this control are apparent when the primary infection is followed by infectious mononucleosis. This is characterized by lymphocytosis and the presence of activated T-cells. The T-cell proliferation is probably the manifestation of the immune response against EBV antigens. However, the reaction of T-cells upon encounter of B-blasts is also likely to contribute to the events. At present, it is difficult to detect an EBV-specific component in the action of the T-cells in the acute phase of mononucleosis exerted on B-cells. However, for the clinical course of the disease the activation of T-cells is important. The activated T-cells may control and also eliminate the B-cells infected by EBV.

The BAS initiates behavior in response to conditioned stimuli for reward (approach) or for relieving nonpunishment (active avoidance). The BIS, which is viewed as an anxiety system, inhibits behavior in response to cues for punishment (passive avoidance) or frustrative nonreward (extinction), and its activity is decreased by the anti-anxiety drugs (alcohol, barbiturates, minor tranquilizers). Thus, the BIS is an arousal system which inhibits rather than energizes behavior. \n \nA review of the literature suggests that heart rate (HR) is strongly associated with activity of the BAS. This interpretation subsumes the previous findings of cardiac-somatic coupling, incentive effects on HR, and increased HR in connection with active coping in the face of threat. Electrodermal activity (EDA), on the other hand, increases when there is an activation of the BIS. A consideration of these differing effects on HR and EDA permits a specification of conditions in which these two measures will or will not show directional fractionation. \n \nWith this theoretical model it is possible to relate the clinical features of psychopathy to the psychophysiological data with the single assumption that primary psychopaths have a deficient BIS.

Regression can be quantified by determining the number of cells required for its expression. To investigate the development of memory T cells with EB\u2010virus specificity in the primary infection, a comparison was made of the capacity for regression of lymphocytes from 16 cases of infectious mononucleosis (IM) and 13 normal donors. With 9 normal seropositive donors a mean lymphocyte concentration of 4.6 \u00d7 105/ml was required to achieve 50% regression. In contrast, with 8 cases of IM tested within I week of onset, a much higher mean lymphocyte concentration (3.7 \u00d7 106/ml) was necessary. Six of these IM cases, and another not tested in the first week, were tested on several occasions between 5 and 23 weeks after onset, and showed a slight reduction in the mean cell concentration required for regression (1.5 \u00d7 1O6/ml). Six additional IM cases were tested 23\u201383 weeks after onset by which time the cell concentration required for 50% regression (mean = 4.5 \u00d7 1O5/ml) had reached the level shown by normal seropositive donors. Regression did not occur with lymphocytes from seronegative donors, even at the highest cell concentration. Recombination cultures of T\u2010cell\u2010de\u2010pleted and T\u2010cell\u2010enriched lymphocyte populations from 3 IM cases in ratios of 1:7 to 7:1 showed that the failure of regression in acute IM was not due simply to lack of sufficient numbers of T cells. The results indicate that EB\u2010virus\u2010specific memory T\u2010cell activity as detected by the regression test is absent in the acute phase of IM, becomes evident at low levels 5\u201323 weeks after onset, and reaches a maximum after about 6 months.", "venue": "International Journal of Cancer", "year": 1980, "referenceCount": 32, "citationCount": 252, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "1980-01-15", "journal": {"volume": "25", "name": "International Journal of Cancer"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Rlckinson1980LongtermTI,\n author = {A.

Urinary catecholamine and cortisol levels were also examined. Residents of the TMI area exhibited greater numbers of neutrophils, which were positively correlated with epinephrine levels. The TMI group also exhibited fewer B lymphocytes, T-suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes, and natural killer cells.
