However, researchers have found that it is actually worry about performance and anxiety\u2014not bodily feelings of anxiety (emotionality)\u2014that impairs performance. Drawing on this insight, anxiety reappraisal interventions encourage the view that anxiety can be neutral or even helpful. Initial evidence\u2014largely from laboratory studies\u2014suggests that these kinds of reappraisal interventions can improve student performance in mathematics. But can they do so in other domains and within the constraints of everyday classroom activities? If so, for whom and how? In an intervention study, we tested whether a minimal reappraisal message embedded in an email from course instructors could improve students\u2019 academic experience and performance in an introductory college course. The night before their first exam, students received an e-mail that either did or did not include a paragraph designed to lead them to interpret exam anxiety as beneficial or at least neutral. First-year students, who experience greater test anxiety and are less certain about how to perform well, benefited from the reappraisal message, showing decreased worry and increased performance on the exam the next day as well as increased performance in the course overall. Mediation analyses revealed that the effect on overall course performance for first-year students was partially mediated by reduced exam worry and enhanced performance on the first exam. The message did not affect the performance of upper year students.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 60, "citationCount": 122, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Mathematics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "tldr": null, "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2017-12-21", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Educational Psychology", "pages": "395\u2013406", "volume": "110"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Brady2017ReappraisingTA,\n author = {Shannon T.

Many students, especially females, feel hesitant about performing gymnastic movements, such as the back roll, due to anxiety. This study aims to determine the differences in anxiety of Class IV Elementary School students in Learning Physical Education Gymnastics Material based on male and female gender.\nMaterials and Methods. This research is comparative. The research subjects were fourth-grade students in Sleman Regency Elementary School, Yogyakarta. The sample was determined using random sampling, totaling 148 students: 65 males, 83 females, aged 10\u201112 years. Subjects were not physically disabled and were willing to participate by filling out a screening questionnaire to ensure they had no medical conditions that might affect the study. The \u201cPhysical Education Continuous Anxiety Scale\u201d was used as the instrument to measure anxiety. The analysis was performed using regression techniques in the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 software.\nResults. Based on the study results, we found that there is a significant difference in anxiety between male and female students in learning Physical Education Gymnastics material (p 0.004 < 0.05). The difference in anxiety between male and female students is 0.12, with female students experiencing higher anxiety than males.\nConclusions. Teachers should strive to create a task-focused, motivating environment and encourage reflection on students\u2019 ability to work under pressure. This approach will increase student engagement, especially in Physical Education Gymnastics, and improve their performance.", "venue": "Fizjoterapia Polska", "year": 2024, "referenceCount": 19, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-08-30", "journal": {"name": "Fizjoterapia Polska"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Susilowati2024AnxietyOC,\n author = {Heni Susilowati and W.

Yet, a common pedagogical hurdle for EFL instructors is fostering students\u2019 confidence in spoken English, an essential skill for cross-cultural communication and collaboration in today\u2019s interconnected world. Therefore, the paper aims to examine why Saudi EFL students may experience comparable challenges in speaking English, akin to those faced by students in other EFL settings. A comprehensive literature review was carried out, exploring speaking reluctance across diverse contexts, including the Saudi EFL setting. The paper adopted an alternative approach to address students\u2019 reservations about speaking. Diverging from the conventional emphasis on motivations and anxiety as primary contributors to speaking reluctance, this study delved deeper, highlighting the underlying conditions that lead to reduced motivation and heightened anxiety. The review\u2019s findings revealed that conditions including, students\u2019 unreadiness, lack of relevance, artificial and limited learning environments, fear, lack of self-confidence, and low proficiency level are critical sources of anxiety, lack of motivation, and interest.

The study delves into the psychological theories and practices that educational psychologists employ to identify, understand, and mitigate these mental health challenges in educational settings. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical studies, the paper examines the effectiveness of various interventions such as cognitive-behavioural strategies, mindfulness programs, and supportive counselling services. Case studies from diverse educational environments are analysed to highlight successful implementations and best practices. The research also investigates the underlying causes of anxiety and stress among students, including academic pressures, social factors, and personal issues, providing a holistic understanding of these conditions. Furthermore, the paper discusses the importance of early identification and continuous support from teachers, parents, and mental health professionals in creating a supportive educational environment. The findings underscore the necessity of integrating educational psychology principles into school curricula and teacher training programs to foster resilience and improve students' mental health outcomes. The paper concludes with recommendations for policy-makers and educational institutions to prioritize mental health resources and develop comprehensive strategies to address student anxiety and stress effectively.

After a baseline performance task, we randomly assigned gamers (n = 300) either to SMI or a control condition in which they learned brain facts. After two weeks of daily gaming, gamers competed in a cash-prize tournament. We measured affective experiences before the matches and cardiovascular responses before and throughout the matches. Contrary to predictions, gamers did not experience negative affect (including feeling stressed), thus limiting the capacity for the intervention to regulate physiological responses and optimize performance. Compared with the control participants, synergistic mindsets participants did not show greater challenge responses or improved performance outcomes.

This questionnaire survey (N\u2009=\u2009551) built on the theory of planned behavior to investigate the determinants of freshmen\u2019s intention to engage in a large-scale FFM program called POLLEM. Results showed that general factors were at work, as well as factors specific to mentoring and to FFM in particular. They revealed that freshmen\u2019s experiential attitude, descriptive norm, injunctive norm and perceived ability matter and highlighted key underlying beliefs (e.g. mentoring boosts self-esteem, shyness impedes engagement) as playing a major role.

Test anxiety is a physical, mental and emotional reaction to threat of failure in exams and consists of worry and perception as components and it may lead to poor academic performance. Objective: To assess the level of test anxiety and its correlation with academic performance among undergraduate students. Methods: This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted from 1st September to 15th December, 2022 with purposive sampling technique to collect the data from the undergraduate students at Sohail University, Karachi. Westside Test Anxiety Scale questionnaire was used. Data were analyzed by using SPSS version 22.0. Descriptive statistics, Mann Whitney and Spearman\u2019s correlation were measured. Results: 44% of the participants were male, 94% were single, 50% were nursing students and 57.5% were 1st and 2nd year undergraduate students. Majority of the respondents (70.5%) were suffering from high to extremely high-test anxiety whereas (17.5 %) participants had mild to moderate level of anxiety. The significant association was found between test anxiety and study program (p-value 0.021). The weak reciprocal correlation coefficient was found between academic performance and test anxiety (r = -.473). Conclusions: Findings of this study suggest that 88% of undergraduates had high to extremely high-test anxiety. A significant link between the study program and level of anxiety and a significant correlation were also found between academic performance and test anxiety. The causes and contributing elements of anxiety must be addressed. The test anxiety puts the undergraduates on high risk for learning deficits and unhealthy consequences.", "venue": "Pakistan journal of health sciences", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 23, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://thejas.com.pk/index.php/pjhs/article/download/970/605", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-31", "journal": {"name": "Pakistan Journal of Health Sciences"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Hameed2023AssessmentOT,\n author = {Khalid Hussain Hameed and Tanseer Ahmed Channa and Amjad Ali Khan and Sahil Khan and Misbah Sarwar Rana and Gayantri Gayantri and Treeza Arif and Imbreena Timmer},\n booktitle = {Pakistan journal of health sciences},\n journal = {Pakistan Journal of Health Sciences},\n title = {Assessment of Test Anxiety and its Correlation with Academic Performance among Undergraduate Students},\n year = {2023}\n}\n"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2242123999", "name": "Khalid Hussain Hameed"}, {"authorId": "2242123815", "name": "Tanseer Ahmed Channa"}, {"authorId": "2242107445", "name": "Amjad Ali Khan"}, {"authorId": "2242211234", "name": "Sahil Khan"}, {"authorId": "2242125653", "name": "Misbah Sarwar Rana"}, {"authorId": "2242124018", "name": "Gayantri Gayantri"}, {"authorId": "2242123907", "name": "Treeza Arif"}, {"authorId": "2240866428", "name": "Imbreena Timmer"}]}, {"paperId": "debd8d5497565eafff4ddcebe020ba135da63bd1", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "10418247", "DOI": "10.5334/joc.313", "CorpusId": 260839230, "PubMed": "37577258"}, "corpusId": 260839230, "publicationVenue": {"id": "032efd06-eab9-4411-8fb0-8473b0e5d375", "name": "Journal of Cognition", "type": "journal", "alternate_names": ["J Cogn"], "issn": "2514-4820", "url": "https://www.journalofcognition.org/"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/debd8d5497565eafff4ddcebe020ba135da63bd1", "title": "Using Reappraisal to Improve Outcomes for STEM Teachers and Students", "abstract": "The many stressors associated with teaching can take a toll, resulting in high levels of burnout among teachers and reduced motivation and academic performance among students.

Students often turn to social media platforms to supplement their learning experience. Purpose: To explore the feasibility of using Instagram tutorials to reduce math anxiety of first-semester prelicensure nursing students. Methods: A quasi-experimental descriptive survey design was used to evaluate the utility of posting supplemental math tutorials on Instagram and examined the effect of tutorials on math anxiety levels. A convenience sample of 20 students used the tutorials. Math anxiety levels were evaluated using the Single-Item Math Anxiety Scale. Results: A statistically significant inverse relationship was observed between math anxiety levels and tutorial use. The Instagram platform was familiar to students and simple to access. Brief tutorials appealed to audio-visual learners.

In the present studies, we use a mixed-methods approach and challenge the rhetoric that students are entirely unaware of effective learning strategies. We show that whether being asked to describe strategies used by poor-, average-, and high-performing students (Study 1) or being asked to judge vignettes of students using different strategies (Study 2), participants are generally readily able to identify effective strategies: they were able to recognize the efficacy of explanation, pretesting, interpolated retrieval practice, and even some interleaving. Despite their knowledge of these effective strategies, they were still unlikely to report using these strategies themselves. In Studies 2 and 3, we also explore the reasons why students might not use the strategies that they know are effective.

Methods: College students in an introductory statistics class (N\u2009=\u2009252; 75.81% female; 18.41% Latino, 25.10% White, 43.93% Asian, 12.56% different racial backgrounds) completed two course exams as part of this naturalistic prepost-experimental design. They provided four reports of positive, depressive, and anxious emotion \u2013 one the day before and one immediately after each exam. Results: As hypothesized, multilevel models (ratings nested within participants) predicting emotion indicated that students with lower mother\u2019s education had less positive emotion, more depressive emotion, and more anxious emotion the day prior to academic exams than students with higher mother\u2019s education (proportional reductions in variance [PRV]\u2009=\u2009.013\u2013.020). Specifically, lower mother\u2019s education was associated with poorer well-being before but not after the exam. Exploratory models revealed that differences in emotion by mother\u2019s education were strongest for students with lower exam scores (PRV\u2009=\u2009.030\u2013.040).

While previous studies have shown that students\u2019 wellbeing and how they manage their emotions are critical to students\u2019 learning, less research has considered their specific impacts on student engagement in online learning. Aims The aim of this study is to examine how students\u2019 subjective wellbeing and emotion regulation strategies (viz cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) are associated with student engagement in online learning during the pandemic. Sample A total of 965 students from a university in China participated in the study. Methods The data were collected online during the COVID\u201019 from March to July 2020, which included measures of wellbeing, emotion regulation strategie, and online learning engagement. Results Structural equation modelling results showed that wellbeing was positively associated with both the use of reappraisal and suppression. Moreover, mediation analysis showed that reappraisal partially mediated the relationship between wellbeing and all types of online learning engagement (including cognitive, emotional and behavioural engagements). Conversely, suppression was found to have a small mediating effect between wellbeing and behavioural engagement of online learning only. No such effect was found on cognitive and emotional engagements. Conclusions The findings provide evidence on the positive relationship between wellbeing and both the strategies of suppression and reappraisal during the pandemic. However, only reappraisal has positive impact on learning, suggesting the importance of effective regulation strategies on students\u2019 online engagement.

ABSTRACT Students majoring in non-STEM fields often identify introductory biology courses as irrelevant and overly rigorous. Resistance to enroll in a required general education science course, coupled with negative attitudes toward the subject, can adversely affect the academic performance of students; this can especially be present in students from under-represented minority groups. Therefore, instructors have to intentionally design a curriculum that overcomes these factors as they educate non-major students enrolled in introductory biology. BioArt, a learning community, was formed between introductory biology and introduction to graphic design courses to improve the attitudes and academic performance of students in the biology course at a Historically Black College and University (HBCU). The BioArt model incorporated a common theme, project-based learning, and opportunities for experiential learning. To measure outcomes, traditional examinations, non-traditional assessments, failure/withdraw rates, and student attitudes were evaluated. Using this model, introductory biology became less intimidating, more relevant, and improved academic success among freshman minority students. Thus, the BioArt model can be utilized as an intervention at different institutions of higher learning.", "venue": "Journal of Microbiology & Biology Education", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 52, "citationCount": 5, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-03-14", "journal": {"volume": "23", "name": "Journal of Microbiology & Biology Education"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Burks2022ImprovingSA,\n author = {T.

Because stress can be magnified for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, it becomes important to identify interventions that can help mitigate this stress, particularly for these populations as they enter academic environments. We examine the effects of stress mindset and stress management interventions administered to students from disadvantaged backgrounds (N = 140) before freshman year. We compare effects on affect, sleep, and performance during end-of-year exams seen in a subset of these students who could be tracked via experience sampling (N = 57) to those of a comparison group at the same elite university (N = 74) receiving no such stress interventions. As predicted, we find significant differences in exam-week positive affect between the stress mindset and comparison groups. However, there was no difference in positive affect between the stress mindset and management groups or the stress management and comparison groups. For negative affect, stress, sleep, and exam performance, we find no significant differences between any of the three groups. However, both stress interventions decoupled the significant negative association between exam-week stress and exam performance exhibited by the comparison group, rendering the relationship nonsignificant. The reduction in this association was somewhat more pronounced for the mindset relative to the management group. These findings suggest that mindset and management approaches both confer benefits in certain circumstances and highlight the potential value of targeting mindsets about stress using a \"wise intervention\" approach for students from disadvantaged backgrounds during stressful times.

Previous research has demonstrated that higher levels of perfectionistic concerns predict higher levels of cognitive test anxiety but has not explored potential mediators of this relationship. This study investigated whether repetitive negative thinking mediated the relationship between perfectionistic concerns and cognitive test anxiety in a non-clinical, academic sample. Methods Participants were Australian university students (N\u2009=\u2009129, 32 male, 94 female, 3 non-binary), aged between 18 and 53 (M\u2009=\u200923.96; SD\u2009=\u20096.88), recruited through convenience and snowball sampling. Participants completed an online questionnaire assessing demographics, repetitive negative thinking, perfectionistic concerns, and cognitive test anxiety. Results Mediation analysis yielded a total model accounting for 43.5% of variance in cognitive TA. Perfectionistic concerns significantly accounted for 10.6% of variance direction (F(1, 127)\u2009=\u200912.21, p\u2009<\u2009.001, \u2009=\u2009.106), and 32.5% indirectly through RNT (F(2,126)\u2009=\u200930.81, p\u2009<\u2009.001, = .329). Conclusions Findings demonstrate that RNT significantly mediates the relationship between perfectionistic concerns and cognitive test anxiety in this sample. Importantly, these findings may direct future studies towards investigating the effectiveness of targeting repetitive negative thinking in interventions to mitigate levels of cognitive test anxiety.", "venue": "Anxiety, Stress, & Coping", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 42, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-10-30", "journal": {"volume": "35", "pages": "662 - 672", "name": "Anxiety, Stress, & Coping"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Jolly2021DoesRN,\n author = {Alex T W Jolly and David Garratt-Reed and P.

College students (n = 498) self-reported their general and source-specific stress mindsets, perceived distress, health, coping, and GPA. Stress mindsets varied as a function of duration and controllability, and general stress mindsets were only weakly associated with source-specific mindsets. Consistent with previous research, general stress mindsets were associated with health, but some source-specific mindsets were more predictive of health than others\u2014viewing stress from chronic controllable sources as debilitating was most predictive of poor mental and physical health. Measures of stress were also associated with health, and this association was moderated by stress mindsets, suggesting that viewing stress as enhancing can provide a psychological \u201cbuffer\u201d against the negative effects of stress. Approach coping and perceived distress were examined as potential mediators of the links between stress mindset and health. Viewing stress as enhancing was related to greater use of approach coping and lower perceived distress, which in turn was related to better health.

This study was conducted by using an experimental design with pretest, posttest, and follow-up with the control group. The participants were 32 students from girl high school students of Tehran which were selected by cluster random sampling from girl high schools and then randomly assigned into control and experimental groups (Each group consisted of 16 students). The instruments used were Dortaj Qualitative Academic Achievement Questionnaire and Motevalli Study Skills Training Module. The experimental group received 8 sessions of psycho-educational group therapy and the control group did not receive any training. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was utilized for the analysis of data. Results revealed that there was a significant increase in qualitative academic achievement between pretest with post-test and follow-up among the experimental group. Moreover, there was a significant increase in qualitative academic achievement between post-test and follow-up in the experimental group with the control group. Additionally, the results showed that there is a significant increase in self-efficacy, planning, and motivation and also a significant decrease in emotional effects and lack of outcome control. In conclusion, the results of this study indicated that on the basis of deficit theory using learning and study skills training can lead to enhance student's skills to improve qualitative academic achievement. Further studies are required to examine whether exposing students to study skills training programs can lead them to enhance their qualitative academic achievement. \n\u00a0 \nKeyword: Motivation Study Skills Training, Planning, Qualitative Academic Achievement, Self-efficacy.", "venue": "Asian Journal of University Education", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 43, "citationCount": 5, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-08-01", "journal": {"name": "Asian Journal of University Education"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Motevalli2021TheEO,\n author = {Saeid Motevalli and Mohd Sahandri Ghani Hamzah and S.

This review integrates relevant studies and offers future directions for research on the role of stress physiology in the school adaptation of elementary school students, focusing on these important questions: (a) What are the links between physiological stress response and learning-related skills and behaviors, and do they vary as a function of proximal and distal experiences outside of school? (b) How are school experiences associated with students\u2019 physiological stress response and related cognitive and behavioral adaptations? (c) How can we leverage measures of students\u2019 physiological stress response in evaluations of school-based interventions to better support the school success of every student?

They quickly realized that breaking action control down into different phases greatly benefited its understanding. Heckhausen and Gollwitzer\u2019s analysis was heavily influenced by the work of Kurt Lewin (e.g., Lewin et al., 1944), for whom there was never any doubt that motivational phenomena can only be properly understood and analyzed from an action perspective that distinguishes the processes of goal setting from those of goal striving, an insight that went unheeded for several decades. Accordingly, Heckhausen and Gollwitzer (1987) proposed the \u201cRubicon\u201dmodel of action phases, which describes the course of action as a temporal, linear path starting with a person\u2019s wishes or desires and ending with the evaluation of the action outcomes achieved. The model was designed to raise and help answer the following questions: How do people select their goals? How do they plan the execution of goal striving? How do they enact these plans? Moreover, how do they evaluate their accomplishments? According to the Rubicon model, a course of action involves a phase of deliberating the desirability and feasibility of one\u2019s wishes at the outset in order to arrive at a binding decision regarding which of them one wants to pursue as a goal (pre-decisional phase), a phase of planning concrete strategies for achieving this goal Practical Summary", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 1914, "citationCount": 21, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-07-23", "journal": {"volume": "", "pages": "77-88", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Keller2020ChangingBU,\n author = {Lucas Keller and P.

Do they work in all contexts? We suggest that lay theory intervention effects depend on psychological affordances, which are defined as cues that allow individuals to view a lay theory as legitimate and adaptive in that context. The present research directly and experimentally tested this hypothesis using the example of a \"purpose for learning\" lay theory intervention, which taught the lay theory that school is a place to develop skills that allow one to make progress toward self-transcendent aims. A double-blind 2 (student purpose intervention) \u00d7 2 (purpose-affording note) field experiment was conducted in a relatively low-performing public middle school in the United States. Students first received a web-based purpose for learning lay theory intervention (or a control activity), and 2 weeks later attended a class in which an assignment was accompanied by a purpose-affording note that was hand-written by a teacher (or a control note). Results showed that the purpose lay theory intervention increased performance on an English class writing assignment, but only when it was accompanied by a purpose-affording note. Exploratory analyses revealed that the effects of the manipulations were apparent among students who were at greater risk for poor performance in the class: nonnative English-speaking students. Thus short, online lay theory interventions may reduce performance gaps, provided that the contexts afford the opportunity for the proffered lay theory to seem legitimate and adaptive.

Problems with roots in, or links with, behavior include debilitating illnesses and chronic conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancers, obesity, sexually transmitted infections), global pandemics of communicable diseases (e.g., SARS, H1N1, COVID-19), mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety), addictions (e.g., substance abuse), social and interpersonal problems (e.g., bullying, abuse and violence in relationships), financial difficulties (e.g., personal debt, problem gambling), criminal behavior (e.g., social disorder, vandalism), educational challenges (e.g., truancy, attentional difficulties), and environmental concerns (e.g., overuse of nonrenewable resources, failures to recycle or save energy). Analogously, regular participation in relevant behaviors is associated with adaptive outcomes such as better health and wellbeing, positive mental health, better functioning in the workplace, in interpersonal relationships, and at school, and more environmentally conscious choices and consumer behavior. Vast databases of archival statistics demonstrating how behavior is linked to social problems are at the disposal of organizations responsible for developing policy to tackle them. Such data signal the need for behavioral solutions and have catalyzed fervent interest in the determinants of behavior and in methods and strategies to change behavior. Governments, organizations (private and public corporations, schools, community organizations), and professionals (government officials, health care workers, managers, teachers) recognize the value of developing strategies to change the behavior of targeted population groups in order to promote adaptive outcomes. To date, legislation (e.g., seat belt use) and regulation (e.g., banning smoking in public places) stand as some of themost successfulmeans to change population behavior. However, in many cases, such initiatives are not possible, feasible, or acceptable. As a consequence, alternative approaches to behavior change are needed. Scientific inquiry into behavior change has entered into the mainstream. Recognition of the importance of behavior change to solving social problems has led governments to engage scientists from various disciplineswithin the social and behavioral sciences to inform policy and develop effective behavior change strategies targeting highpriority, behavior-related problems. For example, governments and organizations have invested in funding initiatives to develop research evidence (e.g., National Cancer Institute, 2019; National Institutes of Health, 2019; Nielsen et al., 2018; OBSSR, 2016), commissioned reports and evidence syntheses (e.g., Behavioral Insights Team, 2019b; Cabinet Office, 2011; NICE, 2007, 2012, 2014), and set up working groups, expert panels, and conferences with an advisory purview on behavior change (e.g., Behavioral Insights Team, 2019a; Brandt & Proulx, 2015; House of Lords, 2011; Ogilvie Consulting, 2019; Spring et al., 2013).", "venue": "The Handbook of Behavior Change", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 1941, "citationCount": 10, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://jyx.jyu.fi/bitstream/123456789/73855/1/changing_behavior_a_theory_and_evidencebased_approach.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Sociology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-07-01", "journal": {"name": "The Handbook of Behavior Change"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Hagger2020ChangingBA,\n author = {M.

Some studies even conclude that Engineering and Medicine students are the ones who suffer the most from academic stress. Experiencing stress directly impacts students health and wellbeing, and might cause them to make behavioral changes and sacri\ufb01ces which in turn also impact their health and academic performance, especially as they undergo long-term unhealthy levels of stress throughout their years of education. At our institution, the admission rate is usually about 10% and the students admitted often pursue double majors along with a minor, while at the same time getting some research experience, applying for internships every summer, and trying to achieve many tasks that would improve their resume to try to secure the best possible future job and life. On top of this pressure, some courses tend be harder than others and/or require more work. This paper discusses the work realized in the Digital Systems course at our institution that has an established reputation of being the course with heaviest load among our Electrical and Computer Engineering courses. This course has been taught for the past two semesters \u2013 Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 \u2013 by a new faculty member who taught it the \ufb01rst semester (Fall) nearly the same way it has been taught for years, studied students\u2019 data and feedback, and redesigned the course the next semester (Spring) aiming to reduce students\u2019 perceived load and stress while maintaining the same high course standards and expectations. Results show that by making a number of small changes to different aspects of the course, the course\u2019s likability increased and students\u2019 stress decreased from the \ufb01rst semester to the second. The small changes included adding a technical workshop at the beginning of the semester to better prepare students to use and debug the hardware description language they will be using throughout the course, combining every pair of homework assignments into one, carefully spreading out due dates on the schedule and never having", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 44, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Engineering", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-06-22", "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Younes2020SimpleST,\n author = {Rabih Younes and Cecilia Sadler},\n title = {Simple Steps to Lower Student Stress in a Digital Systems Course While Maintaining High Standards and Expectations},\n year = {2020}\n}\n"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "20537874", "name": "Rabih Younes"}, {"authorId": "97662943", "name": "Cecilia Sadler"}]}, {"paperId": "cf793407f94698dc89650792cb14b8fffee5fb21", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3034696485", "PubMedCentral": "7325947", "DOI": "10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01141", "CorpusId": 219636630, "PubMed": "32655435"}, "corpusId": 219636630, "publicationVenue": {"id": "89097a03-8be6-4e2d-ae2c-a6df64c77a06", "name": "Frontiers in Psychology", "type": "journal", "alternate_names": ["Front Psychol"], "issn": "1664-1078", "url": "http://www.frontiersin.org/Cultural_Psychology", "alternate_urls": ["http://frontiersin.org/psychology/", "https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology", "http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/psychology", "http://www.frontiersin.org/psychology"]}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf793407f94698dc89650792cb14b8fffee5fb21", "title": "Revealing Nuanced Relationships Among Cognitive Test Anxiety, Motivation, and Self-Regulation Through Curvilinear Analyses", "abstract": "Student motivational profiles and self-regulated learning strategies are significant influences on overall academic success in university settings. Test anxiety has been repeatedly linked to maladaptive learning strategies and ineffective motivational frameworks. However, the results in the field have been inconsistent with respect to the precise interactions among these variables. This study employed anonymous responses from a group of volunteer students in a mid-sized Midwestern United States university, serving a primarily Caucasian and female population with an average age of 20 years. Adopting a curvilinear analytic design, this study attempted to examine the relationships among these common domains of inquiry into student thriving. The results of this study provide insights examining under which conditions cognitive test anxiety is most likely to be heightened or diminished. The results demonstrated that levels of test anxiety were greatest when (a) learners adopted primarily extrinsic or primarily intrinsic goal orientations, (b) academic tasks where the outcome was uncertain, (c) learners adopted passive learning strategies, and (d) learning strategies were more personally involved (as opposed to externalized study behaviors). Our results add to the field by identifying curvilinear models provide greater utility in identifying the relationships among these critical emotional and cognitive factors in academic settings.

The evidence provided by psychologists and educators has shown that students\u2019 interaction (student-student (SS) interaction, student-instructor (SI) interaction, and student-content (SC) interaction) significantly affects their learning persistence, which is also related to their academic emotions. However, few studies explore the relations among students\u2019 interaction, academic emotions and learning persistence in online learning environments. Furthermore, no research has focused on multi-dimensional students\u2019 interaction and specific academic emotions. Based on person-environment interaction model and transactional distance theory, this study investigates the relationship between students\u2019 interaction and learning persistence from the perspective of moderation and mediation of academic emotions including enjoyment, boredom, and anxiety. Data were collected from 339 students who had online learning experience in China. AMOS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) were employed to analyze the mediating and moderating effects of academic emotions, respectively.

We further integrate these theories with the extended process model of emotion regulation (Gross, 2015).

With this optimization goal in mind, individuals are invited to flexibly identify, select, and engage in specific regulation tactics (e.g., situation selection, attentional control, cognitive change, and response modulation) in ways that help them achieve valued ends as opposed to merely reducing or avoiding stressful experiences.

Such forward testing effect occurs, in part, because interim testing provides learners with an opportunity to evaluate their learning strategies and allows them to use more effective strategies in their subsequent learning. We hypothesized that making metacognitive judgments of prior learning would also have similar effects, as it would directly require learners to think about their own learning status. Three experiments examined whether an act of making judgments of learning (JOLs) on prior material could facilitate the learning of new material in inductive learning, namely, creating a forward effect of metacognitive judgments. Participants studied painting styles of various artists, which were divided into two separate sections (Sections A and B). They were asked to provide JOLs, restudy, or take a test on the studied paintings of Section A before moving on to study the paintings of different artists in Section B, and then were given a final cumulative test where participants had to transfer what they had previously learned to new exemplars of the studied artists. The results indicated that simply requiring learners to make item-level JOLs (Experiment 1) did not facilitate learning compared with restudy, but the act of making category-level JOLs (Experiment 2) and global metacognitive judgments (Experiment 3) facilitated the learning of new materials. The findings suggest that making a JOL is not a neutral activity and that it can influence learners\u2019 subsequent study behavior and learning outcomes.

In so doing, we provide a comprehensive theoretical review and organization of a psychologically informed approach to social problems, one that encompasses a wide-range of interventions and applies to diverse problem areas.", "venue": "Psychology Review", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 482, "citationCount": 329, "influentialCitationCount": 13, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2018-10-01", "journal": {"volume": "125", "pages": "617\u2013655", "name": "Psychological Review"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Walton2018WiseIP,\n author = {G.

Often, a student\u2019s desire to perform well in these evaluative situations leads them to experience test-anxiety. However, test-anxiety has been repeatedly correlated with reduced test performance. Research suggests that reappraisal interventions promote the reduction of test anxiety which may result in improved test performance. But can linguistic tense mediate the effect of these interventions? If so, are these interventions helpful for GT students for whom test anxiety is a significant concern? This intervention study tested whether reading a message containing a type of reappraisal technique, objective psychological distancing, in a certain linguistic tense could reduce test anxiety and improve test performance for high school GT algebra students. Two hours before taking an exam, students read one of three messages: a first-person distancing, a third-person distancing, or a control message. There existed a slight improvement in student test performance from the control condition to the distancing conditions, yet this trend was not statistically significant. \u00a0", "venue": "Journal of student-scientists' research", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 41, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"name": "Journal of Student Research"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Kota2021TenseOP,\n author = {Nikitha Kota and A.

While teachers may think that issues of anxiety in education are either overhyped or overemphasized, learners think otherwise. To analyze the views of the preservice teacher on the concept of test anxiety especially on its influence on the academic performance of students, a mixed research design was adopted for this study. An experimental approach followed by semi-structured interviews were used to elicit information on the impact of test anxiety on the academic performance. A total of 42 participants were purposively chosen which were divided into 2 groups, A (control group) and B (experimental group). A reliable and validated post-test was administered where there was an induced stress on the experimental group before commencing an examination. The findings of this study argued that though test anxiety affected students test scores to a large extent, other possible factors were responsible for learner\u2019s test scores as well.

The two research fields have proceeded independently in the literature at least until recently and the thesis highlights their integration. The thesis aims to answer: what happens in the brain during cognitive reappraisal and how can we use cognitive reappraisal as a strategy for dealing with academic anxiety. Brain-imaging studies show that cognitive reappraisal (an emotion regulation strategy) involves many different higher-order cognitive processes, such as emotion processing, manipulation of appraisals in working memory, inhibiting the old and selecting new appraisals. Different regions of the prefrontal cortex are believed to support these functions, moreover, the prefrontal cortex modulates amygdala activity and decreases negative emotions. Previous research in the lab and in the classroom suggests that cognitive reappraisal might be a strategy for dealing with academic anxiety. The arousal reappraisal intervention encourages students to reinterpret their increased arousal as beneficial to their performance. Only a small number of studies have tested the intervention in academic contexts, however the results are promising, e.g. students improved exam performance. The goal is to teach students that it is possible to perform well regardless of one\u2019s anxiety.

There are students who are able to cope with those challenges easily, but some of them have to struggle due to some serious cases they have, such as: communication anxiety, family related issue, lack of self-confident, bullying, etc. Those problems may increase the level of self-discomfort which then affect their academic performance. In order to help those students in facing their problem, Spiritual Emotional Freedom Technique (S-EFT) was applied. S-EFT is performed to ensure the energy flows smoothly in the body by tapping certain points of acupuncture. When the energy is balance, the biochemical system in the body will be influenced as well. While this process occurred, the therapist also reads the affirmation sentence to help the client release the stress and decrease self-discomfort. In this condition, usually, the brain wave is at alpha, so the affirmations will be accepted by the unconscious mind and level of sincerity (ikhla\u1e63) could be achieved.

Ninety-three students (across five semesters) enrolled in a community college developmental mathematics course were randomly assigned to stress reappraisal or placebo control conditions. Reappraisal instructions educated students about the adaptive benefits of stress arousal, whereas placebo materials instructed students to ignore stress.

The present research examines how a motivational process triggered by a social-psychological intervention propagates benefits over a long period of time and creates an enduring shift in the way people interpret subsequent adversity. During their first or second year of college, 183 Latino and White students completed either a values affirmation intervention or control exercise as part of a laboratory study. In the affirmation intervention, students wrote about a core personal value, an exercise that has been found in previous research to buffer minority students against the stress of being negatively stereotyped in school. This single affirmation improved the college grade point average (GPA) of Latino students over 2 years. Students were re-recruited for a follow-up session near the end of those 2 years. Results indicated that GPA benefits occurred, in part, because the affirmation shifted the way Latino students spontaneously responded to subsequent stressors. In particular, in response to an academic stressor salience task about their end-of-semester requirements, affirmed Latino students spontaneously generated more self-affirming and less self-threatening thoughts and feelings as assessed by an open-ended writing prompt. They also reported having a greater sense of their adequacy as assessed by measures of self-integrity, self-esteem, and hope, as well as higher academic belonging. Discussion centers on how and why motivational processes can trigger effects that persist over surprisingly long periods of time.

I find that an overwhelming majority of people believe trying to calm down is the best way to cope with pre-performance anxiety. However, across several studies involving karaoke singing, public speaking, and math performance, I investigate an alternative strategy: reappraising anxiety as excitement. Compared with those who attempt to calm down, individuals who reappraise their anxious arousal as excitement feel more excited and perform better. Individuals can reappraise anxiety as excitement using minimal strategies such as self-talk (e.g., saying \"I am excited\" out loud) or simple messages (e.g., \"get excited\"), which lead them to feel more excited, adopt an opportunity mind-set (as opposed to a threat mind-set), and improve their subsequent performance. These findings suggest the importance of arousal congruency during the emotional reappraisal process.", "venue": "Journal of experimental psychology.

The studies analyzed here document that active learning leads to increases in examination performance that would raise average grades by a half a letter, and that failure rates under traditional lecturing increase by 55% over the rates observed under active learning. The analysis supports theory claiming that calls to increase the number of students receiving STEM degrees could be answered, at least in part, by abandoning traditional lecturing in favor of active learning. To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes\u2014although the greatest effects are in small (n \u2264 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 270, "citationCount": 6541, "influentialCitationCount": 381, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/111/23/8410.full.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Mathematics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Engineering", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Mathematics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-12", "journal": {"volume": "111", "pages": "8410 - 8415", "name": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Freeman2014ActiveLI,\n author = {S.

However, questions remain concerning the quantification of these gender differences and the identification of relevant moderator variables. The present meta-analysis answered these questions by examining studies that included an evaluation of gender differences in teacher-assigned school marks in elementary, junior/middle, or high school or at the university level (both undergraduate and graduate). The final analysis was based on 502 effect sizes drawn from 369 samples. A multilevel approach to meta-analysis was used to handle the presence of nonindependent effect sizes in the overall sample. This method was complemented with an examination of results in separate subject matters with a mixed-effects meta-analytic model. A small but significant female advantage (mean d = 0.225, 95% CI [0.201, 0.249]) was demonstrated for the overall sample of effect sizes. Noteworthy findings were that the female advantage was largest for language courses (mean d = 0.374, 95% CI [0.316, 0.432]) and smallest for math courses (mean d = 0.069, 95% CI [0.014, 0.124]). Source of marks, nationality, racial composition of samples, and gender composition of samples were significant moderators of effect sizes. Finally, results showed that the magnitude of the female advantage was not affected by year of publication, thereby contradicting claims of a recent \"boy crisis\" in school achievement. The present meta-analysis demonstrated the presence of a stable female advantage in school marks while also identifying critical moderators.

Once admitted, these students tend to struggle academically, compared with continuing-generation students--students who have at least 1 parent with a 4-year degree. We propose a cultural mismatch theory that identifies 1 important source of this social class achievement gap. Four studies test the hypothesis that first-generation students underperform because interdependent norms from their mostly working-class backgrounds constitute a mismatch with middle-class independent norms prevalent in universities. First, assessing university cultural norms, surveys of university administrators revealed that American universities focus primarily on norms of independence. Second, identifying the hypothesized cultural mismatch, a longitudinal survey revealed that universities' focus on independence does not match first-generation students' relatively interdependent motives for attending college and that this cultural mismatch is associated with lower grades. Finally, 2 experiments at both private and public universities created a match or mismatch for first-generation students and examined the performance consequences. Together these studies revealed that representing the university culture in terms of independence (i.e., paving one's own paths) rendered academic tasks difficult and, thereby, undermined first-generation students' performance. Conversely, representing the university culture in terms of interdependence (i.e., being part of a community) reduced this sense of difficulty and eliminated the performance gap without adverse consequences for continuing-generation students.

The intervention aimed to lessen psychological perceptions of threat on campus by framing social adversity as common and transient. It used subtle attitude-change strategies to lead participants to self-generate the intervention message. The intervention was expected to be particularly beneficial to African-American students (N = 49), a stereotyped and socially marginalized group in academics, and less so to European-American students (N = 43). Consistent with these expectations, over the 3-year observation period the intervention raised African Americans\u2019 grade-point average (GPA) relative to multiple control groups and halved the minority achievement gap. This performance boost was mediated by the effect of the intervention on subjective construal: It prevented students from seeing adversity on campus as an indictment of their belonging.

You hit the wrong note, drop the ball, get stumped by a simple question. In other words, you choke. It's not fun to think about, but now there's good news: This doesn't have to happen.Dr. Sian Beilock, an expert on performance and brain science, reveals in \"Choke \"the astonishing new science of why we all too often blunder when the stakes are high. What happens in our brain and body when we experience the dreaded performance anxiety? And what are we doing differently when everything magically \"clicks\" into place and the perfect golf swing, tricky test problem, or high-pressure business pitch becomes easy? In an energetic tour of the latest brain science, with surprising insights on every page, Beilock explains the inescapable links between body and mind; reveals the surprising similarities among the ways performers, students, athletes, and business people choke; and shows how to succeed brilliantly when it matters most. In lively prose and accessibly rendered science, Beilock examines how attention and working memory guide human performance, how experience and practice and brain development interact to create our abilities, and how stress affects all these factors. She sheds new light on counter-intuitive realities, like why the highest performing people are most susceptible to choking under pressure, why we may learn foreign languages best when we're not paying attention, why early childhood athletic training can backfire, and how our emotions can make us both smarter and dumber. All these fascinating findings about academic, athletic, and creative intelligence come together in Beilock's new ideas about performance under pressure--and her secrets to never choking again.

Some demands are just not feasible, whereas others are constricted by restrictions relating to publication.

Next, it will be argued that replication addresses the important connection between existing and new knowledge. To do so it has to be applied explicitly and systematically.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners.

Gender differences in cognitive test anxiety were documented, but those differences were not related to performance on the course exams. Examination of the relation between the emotionality component of test anxiety and performance revealed that moderate levels of physiological arousal generally were associated with higher exam performance. The results were consistent with cognitive appraisal and information processing models of test anxiety and support the conclusion that cognitive test anxiety exerts a significant stable and negative impact on academic performance measures.", "venue": "", "year": 2002, "referenceCount": 56, "citationCount": 1214, "influentialCitationCount": 86, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2002-04-01", "journal": {"volume": "27", "pages": "270-295", "name": "Contemporary Educational Psychology"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Cassady2002CognitiveTA,\n author = {J.

It will first argue that language anxiety is a specific anxiety \u2014 rather than a trait anxiety \u2014 and discuss how this conceptualization has helped clarify the research literature. After Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986) proposed that a specific anxiety construct which they called Foreign Language Anxiety was responsible for students' uncomfortable experiences in language classes and offered an instrument, the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS), to measure this anxiety, findings concerning anxiety and language achievement have been relatively uniform, indicating a consistent moderate negative relationship between anxiety and achievement. However, some researchers (Sparks and Ganschow and their colleagues) have suggested that poor language learning is a cause rather than a result of language anxiety. This review concludes that anxiety is indeed a cause of poor language learning in some individuals and discusses possible sources of this anxiety, including difficulty in authentic self-presentation and various language teaching practices. In addition, it reports on new trends in language anxiety research that attempt to identify aspects of language learning (e.g., reading anxiety or writing anxiety) which provoke anxiety for some individuals.", "venue": "Annual Review of Applied Linguistics", "year": 2001, "referenceCount": 47, "citationCount": 1346, "influentialCitationCount": 204, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Linguistics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2001-01-01", "journal": {"volume": "21", "pages": "112 - 126", "name": "Annual Review of Applied Linguistics"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Horwitz2001LanguageAA,\n author = {E.

Whereas negative consequences of experiencing intergroup anxiety are well documented, the role of perceived anxiety has received substantially less theoretical and empirical attention. We demonstrate in 3 experiments that the perception of anxiety in others can undermine intergroup interactions even when the anxiety can be attributed to a source that is unrelated to the interaction. Participants who learned that a cross-race partner\u2019s anxiety could be attributed to an upcoming evaluation (Study 1) or a stimulant (i.e., caffeine, Studies 2 and 3) expressed less interest in continuing an interaction (Studies 1 and 2), showed less self-disclosure (Study 2), and increased physical distance between themselves and their partner (Study 3) than did those given no source information and participants who interacted with a same-race partner. Moreover, compared to control participants, perceivers who were given an incidental explanation for their partner\u2019s anxiety perceived outgroup, but not ingroup, partners as more anxious (Studies 1 and 3) and showed heightened accessibility of anxiety words (Study 3), indicating that incidental source information enhanced accessibility of intergroup (but not intragroup) anxiety at early stages of information processing.

New York: W. H. Freeman (www.whfreeman.com). 1997, 604 pp., $46.00 (hardcover). Enter the term \"self-efficacy\" in the on-line PSYCLIT database and you will find over 2500 articles, all of which stem from the seminal contributions of Albert Bandura. It is difficult to do justice to the immense importance of this research for our theories, our practice, and indeed for human welfare. Self-efficacy (SE) has proven to be a fruitful construct in spheres ranging from phobias (Bandura, Jeffery, & Gajdos, 1975) and depression (Holahan & Holahan, 1987) to career choice behavior (Betz & Hackett, 1986) and managerial functioning (Jenkins, 1994). Bandura's Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control is the best attempt so far at organizing, summarizing, and distilling meaning from this vast and diverse literature. Self-Efficacy may prove to be Bandura's magnum opus. Dr. Bandura has done an impressive job of summarizing over 1800 studies and papers, integrating these results into a coherent framework, and detailing implications for theory and practice. While incorporating prior works such as Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1977) and \"Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency\" (Bandura, 1982), Self-Efficacy extends these works by describing results of diverse new research, clarifying and extending social cognitive theory, and fleshing out implications of the theory for groups, organizations, political bodies, and societies. Along the way, Dr. Bandura masterfully contrasts social cognitive theory with many other theories of human behavior and helps chart a course for future research. Throughout, B andura' s clear, firm, and self-confident writing serves as the perfect vehicle for the theory he espouses. Self-Efficacy begins with the most detailed and clear explication of social cognitive theory that I have yet seen, and proceeds to delineate the nature and sources of SE, the well-known processes via which SE mediates human behavior, and the development of SE over the life span. After laying this theoretical groundwork, subsequent chapters delineate the relevance of SE to human endeavor in a variety of specific content areas including cognitive and intellectual functioning; health; clinical problems including anxiety, phobias, depression, eating disorders, alcohol problems, and drug abuse; athletics and exercise activity; organizations; politics; and societal change. In Bandura's words, \"Perceived self-efficacy refers to beliefs in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to produce given attainments\" (p. 3). People's SE beliefs have a greater effect on their motivation, emotions, and actions than what is objectively true (e.g., actual skill level). Therefore, SE beliefs are immensely important in choice of behaviors (including occupations, social relationships, and a host of day-to-day behaviors), effort expenditure, perseverance in pursuit of goals, resilience to setbacks and problems, stress level and affect, and indeed in our ways of thinking about ourselves and others. Bandura affirms many times that humans are proactive and free as well as determined: They are \"at least partial architects of their own destinies\" (p. 8). Because SE beliefs powerfully affect human behaviors, they are a key factor in human purposive activity or agency; that is, in human freedom. Because humans shape their environment even as they are shaped by it, SE beliefs are also pivotal in the construction of our social and physical environments. Bandura details over two decades of research confirming that SE is modifiable via mastery experiences, vicarious learning, verbal persuasion, and interpretation of physiological states, and that modified SE strongly and consistently predicts outcomes. SE beliefs, then, are central to human self-determination. STRENGTHS One major strength of Self-Efficacy is Bandura's ability to deftly dance from forest to trees and back again to forest, using specific, human examples and concrete situations to highlight his major theoretical premises, to which he then returns. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 1977, "referenceCount": 2, "citationCount": 51431, "influentialCitationCount": 9162, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Bandura1977SelfEfficacyTE,\n author = {A.

Yet it seemed to me that the experiment itself changes the circumstances of observation. I felt it would be necessary to examine the effects of being in an experiment in order to make inference from those circumstances to a larger life situation. It seemed naive to assume that human subjects respond only to those aspects of the experiment that we define as stimuli. Rather, they, as well as the experimenter, realized that there was a larger purpose in an experiment and that their perception of this larger purpose would affect how they perceived what was happening in the microcosm of the experiment and could dramatically alter their response. In a number of demonstrations it was possible to show how powerful the experimental setting is and how different some observations obtained in that setting would be from those obtained in another setting. \" This paper reported work done at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, Boston. It appeared at a time when there was an increasing dissatisfaction with the naive behavioral approach. The observations affected all research with human subjects, and I proposed procedures for assessing the extent to which being in an experiment is likely to affect a subject's behavior.
