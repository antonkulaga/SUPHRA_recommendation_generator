Whether working from home is the key or impediment to academics\u2019 efficiency and work-life balance became a daunting question for both scientists and their employers. The recent pandemic brought into focus the merits and challenges of working from home on a level of personal experience. Using a convenient sampling, we surveyed 704 academics while working from home and found that the pandemic lockdown decreased the work efficiency for almost half of the researchers but around a quarter of them were more efficient during this time compared to the time before. Based on the gathered personal experience, 70% of the researchers think that in the future they would be similarly or more efficient than before if they could spend more of their work-time at home. They indicated that in the office they are better at sharing thoughts with colleagues, keeping in touch with their team, and collecting data, whereas at home they are better at working on their manuscript, reading the literature, and analyzing their data. Taking well-being also into account, 66% of them would find it ideal to work more from home in the future than they did before the lockdown. These results draw attention to how working from home is becoming a major element of researchers\u2019 life and that we have to learn more about its influencer factors and coping tactics in order to optimize its arrangements.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 63, "citationCount": 101, "influentialCitationCount": 9, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249127&type=printable", "status": "GOLD"}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Sociology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "tldr": {"model": "tldr@v2.0.0", "text": "It is found that the pandemic lockdown decreased the work efficiency for almost half of the researchers but around a quarter of them were more efficient during this time compared to the time before, and that working from home is becoming a major element of researchers\u2019 life."}, "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-09-23", "journal": {"name": "PLoS ONE", "volume": "16"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Aczel2020ResearchersWF,\n author = {B.

While studies have examined issues revolving around working from home, research on hybrid work environment is lacking, particularly in Malaysian contexts. This study aims to examine work burnout issues faced by language lecturers in a hybrid work landscape. \n\u00a0 \nMethodology: A quantitative cross-sectional survey design was employed in this study. An adapted Copenhagen Burnout Inventory was administered online to 130 language lecturers from two public universities in Selangor through random sampling procedure. To determine levels of personal, work-related, and colleague-related burnout, data were analysed using descriptive statistics analyses which were conducted on SPSS Version 29. \n\u00a0 \nFindings: The findings revealed that personal and work-related burnout are perceived as sometimes contributing to burnout. Conversely, colleague-related burnout is perceived less frequently, suggesting minimal impact on burnout in interactions with colleagues. The overall low burnout levels suggest that hybrid working could be an effective arrangement for educators in the long run. \nContributions: The insights gained on work burnout among language lecturers will be particularly useful in maneuvering work effectively in academia, with the hope to address issues within the UN SDG Goal 3 where good health and well-being would be the focus. \n\u00a0 \nKeywords: Work-life balance, hybrid workplace, burnout, academia, language lecturers. \n\u00a0 \nCite as: Azizan, M., Shafie, H., Mohd Jaafar, N., Komarudin, N.

While introducing remote work offers numerous economic benefits for organizations, this transition must be aligned with employees' needs rather than in an authoritarian manner. Our research aimed to investigate how sub-factors of technostress, directly and indirectly, influence the satisfaction and desire to work from home. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a sample of 361 office workers with at least two years of experience who have spent some time working from home. We checked our hypotheses with a path model. Results Our research found that techno-insecurity and techno-complexity have a minimal direct influence on the desire to work from home. However, the desire to work from home significantly decreases through various mediation pathways via the status sub-factor (which can be seen as one of the latent benefits of remote work) and through satisfaction with working from home. Our model explains 33.7% of the variance in the desire to work from home.

The impact of WFH on careers is rather ambiguous, and a question remains open about how this effect is manifested in the current times considering the recent extensive and widespread use of WFH during the pandemic. To answer these questions, this article investigates whether managerial preferences for promotion, salary increase and training allowance depend on employee engagement in WFH. We take into account the employee\u2019s gender, parental status as well as the frequency of WFH. Furthermore, we examine whether managers\u2019 experience with WFH and its prevalence in the team moderate the effect of WFH on careers. An online survey experiment was run on a sample of over 1,000 managers from the United Kingdom. The experiment was conducted between July and December 2022. The findings indicate that employees who WFH are less likely to be considered for promotion, salary increase and training than on-site workers. The pay and promotion penalties for WFH are particularly true for men (both fathers and non-fathers) and childless women, but not mothers. We also find that employees operating in teams with a higher prevalence of WFH do not experience negative career effects when working from home. Additionally, the more WFH experience the manager has, the lesser the career penalty for engaging in this mode of working. Our study not only provides evidence on WFH and career outcomes in the post-pandemic context but also furthers previous understanding of how WFH impacts careers by showing its effect across different groups of employees, highlighting the importance of familiarisation and social acceptance of flexible working arrangements in their impact on career outcomes.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2024, "referenceCount": 71, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303307&type=printable", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Economics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Sociology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-05-15", "journal": {"volume": "19", "name": "PLOS ONE"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Kasperska2024ManagerialT,\n author = {Agnieszka Kasperska and Anna Matysiak and Ewa Cukrowska-Torzewska},\n booktitle = {PLoS ONE},\n journal = {PLOS ONE},\n title = {Managerial (dis)preferences towards employees working from home: Post-pandemic experimental evidence},\n volume = {19},\n year = {2024}\n}\n"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2301419009", "name": "Agnieszka Kasperska"}, {"authorId": "2258396850", "name": "Anna Matysiak"}, {"authorId": "2301418942", "name": "Ewa Cukrowska-Torzewska"}]}, {"paperId": "f2a05199d28fb175814b516466c3eda22e8c2b3f", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "11081233", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0302296", "CorpusId": 269643805, "PubMed": "38722928"}, "corpusId": 269643805, "publicationVenue": {"id": "0aed7a40-85f3-4c66-9e1b-c1556c57001b", "name": "PLoS ONE", "type": "journal", "alternate_names": ["Plo ONE", "PLOS ONE", "PLO ONE"], "issn": "1932-6203", "url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/", "alternate_urls": ["http://www.plosone.org/"]}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f2a05199d28fb175814b516466c3eda22e8c2b3f", "title": "Person-organization fit and job burnout of researchers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Heterogeneity in eleven countries", "abstract": "To manage the negative impact of job burnout for the researchers, especially during COVID-19 pandemic, is not easy. Thus, it is essential for educational institutions to provide them with the support they need to improve the person-organization (P-O) fit. Drawing upon the data from the Nature\u2019s Global Survey initiated in 2021, this paper analyzed 2,424 effective samples from eleven countries in the world to investigate how P-O fit impacts researchers\u2019 job burnout in different countries and their career stages during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings show that both organizational support and P-O fit have significantly assisted researchers in all career stages to reduce job burnout. Moreover, P-O fit has a greater inhibitory effect on job burnout than organizational support. However, when resources are relatively scarce in some developing countries, it is more important to provide organizational support for researchers. Therefore, in order to improve the efficiency of organizational support and reduce researchers\u2019 job burnout, those aspects which are less fit but helpful should be increased appropriately.

It has accelerated the implementation of WFH and has raised questions about its further use.\nPurpose of the article: The article analyzes the experience of employees in the Czech Republic with WFH during the coronavirus pandemic to identify perceived benefits, difficulties, skills, and conditions related to WFH, assess the employee desire to work from home depending on their industry, age, and gender, and propose actions for further use of WFH beyond the coronavirus pandemic. The statistical verification of the dependence of the desire of employees to work from home beyond the coronavirus pandemic on their industry, age, and gender is integral to the analysis.\nMethods: The analysis is founded on data from the authors' online questionnaire survey conducted from December 2021 to September 2022. Responses from 480 employees who experienced WFH during the coronavirus pandemic in the Czech Republic are analyzed. Statistical non-parametric methods for the analysis of nominal data are used to verify defined hypotheses.\nFindings & value added: A research gap concerning the further use of WFH in the Czech Republic and elsewhere by considering the employee experience is met. The findings have revealed the desire of more than half of surveyed employees to continue working from home part-time to achieve reasonable work-personal-family well-being. The desire turned out to be dependent on the employees' industry. Within further use, WFH should be taken as a specific work pattern for suitable professions and individuals with adequate organizational and technical support. Three matters concerning performance agreement, work environment, and self-management are proposed to enhance work-personal-family well-being and thus job satisfaction and productivity of homeworkers.

The aim of this study was to identify potential differences in the level of theoretically established job stressors between WFH and regular office work, especially with respect to working parents with childcare responsibilities.We tested the relevant working conditions by conducting repeated online surveys with three measurement times between 2020 and 2022 (N = 1,144 in total).Paired sample t-tests for each measurement time showed significant differences between WFH and work in the office for six out of seven psychosocial risk factors (e.g., social relationships with supervisors and colleagues). Only work intensity did not differ between WFH and work in the office. The specific challenges for WFH parents caring for children were revealed in a decreased work continuity compared to employees without childcare responsibilities. Our results suggest that job stressors are contingent on the place of work.In conclusion, while WFH affords the opportunity to counterbalance job stressors in the long term, it requires the support of social relationships, especially for full-time WFH employees.

In this research, the authors studied the future of WFH by analyzing perceived home productivity and work\u2013life balance (WLB) in the WFH environment. This paper attempts to say that WFH is here to stay, and business leaders should acknowledge this fact and adjust their strategy.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe authors used a heterogeneous sampling method, surveying 1,157 employees in Mexico on productivity and WLB. The authors did three independent interventions in different pandemic stages: beginning \u2013 in 2020, peaking \u2013 in 2021, and calming down \u2013 in 2022. The authors used contingency table analysis to research the influence of perceived productivity and WLB in WFH on employees\u2019 propensity to WFH.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results show that employees perceive productivity the same or higher when WFH and WLB same or better. The findings of this study are a wake-up call for managers who refuse to embrace changes in employees\u2019 perceptions and needs. Companies refusing to acknowledge the existing need for WFH may face significant challenges in terms of employee satisfaction and retention.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study contributes to the broader literature by addressing whether WFH is here to stay. The dynamics of returning to office vary from country to country, industry to industry and business to business. This paper is an answer to the future of WFH for Mexico and the Latin American region.\n", "venue": "Management Research: Journal of the Iberoamerican Academy of Management", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 51, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/MRJIAM-05-2023-1424/full/pdf?title=is-work-from-home-here-to-stay-look-from-mexicoel-trabajo-desde-casa-llego-para-quedarse-mirada-desde-mexicoo-trabalho-em-casa-veio-para-ficar-olha-do-mexico", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Sociology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Economics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-26", "journal": {"name": "Management Research: Journal of the Iberoamerican Academy of Management"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Lapshun2023IsWF,\n author = {Alexander Lapshun and Sergio Madero G\u00f3mez},\n booktitle = {Management Research: Journal of the Iberoamerican Academy of Management},\n journal = {Management Research: Journal of the Iberoamerican Academy of Management},\n title = {Is work from home here to stay?

In 2023, as we navigate the post-pandemic times, questions persist regarding potential disparities and enduring effects faced by volcanology researchers, whose activities range from field work in remote areas to laboratory experiments and numerical modelling. In this study, we explore the multifaceted impacts of the pandemic on volcanology researchers through an online survey distributed globally from January to March 2023. Our survey findings reveal that a considerable fraction of volcanology researchers (44%\u201362%) face longer-term challenges from the pandemic that continue to impact their research, with a notably higher proportion among early career researchers (62%) and researchers with disabilities (76%). In addition, over half (52%) of all surveyed researchers indicated that they had left or considered leaving academia due to pandemic-related factors. A significantly higher proportion of disabled researchers (56%\u201370%) had left or considered leaving academia compared to researchers without disabilities (42%). Our findings underscore the pandemic\u2019s long-lasting and disproportionate impacts on early career and disabled volcanology researchers. We emphasis the need for concerted efforts by research organisations and funding bodies to mitigate the pandemic\u2019s enduring impacts, and stress the importance of making conferences accessible to support disabled researchers\u2019 participation. As the pandemic\u2019s long-lasting impacts ripple across the broader scientific community, the insights from this research can be used for fostering equitable practices and shaping policies beyond volcanology to other research disciplines.", "venue": "Frontiers in Earth Science", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 26, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2023.1291975/pdf?isPublishedV2=False", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-12-04", "journal": {"name": "Frontiers in Earth Science"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Chim2023DisproportionateIO,\n author = {M.

A systematic search strategy was carried out through Scopus as the single electronic citation database in this bibliometric analysis. The findings reveal that the publication of cloud computing has been steadily maintained at the same rate for last few years except in 2020 which could be due to higher concentration on COVID related publications. Besides that, the cloud computing publications were reduced could be due to work from home situation which pull down the work efficiency and another possibility is cloud computing publications have started to decline and overtaken by other technologies due to the interest and demand from the academics and market, but this must be observed in next following 2 to 3 years to confirm on this. Precisely, the finding of this bibliometric analysis shows that countries with higher cloud computing literature publications tends to have higher cloud computing growth rate which implies that local government and related bodies are playing an important role to facilitate the technology awareness and transformation. This study contributes to cloud computing research by providing holistic insights of its literature development since 2018 by understanding its development, growth pattern, and contributions by the topmost affiliations/institutions, countries, authors, publishers in this area.

However, this segment grew dramatically in March 2020 when the COVID-19 lockdowns forced office employees to work from home (WFH). Because the merging of employment with the dwelling has affected the genders unevenly, we focused on the WFH experiences of women, living in the metropolitan area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with occupations that could be performed remotely during the pandemic. We further explored how women used their agency to overcome material and behavioral challenges encountered in the home workspace by implementing innovative modifications. Using a mixed-methods approach, data were collected from 96 women with an online questionnaire, followed by 15 semi-structured interviews. The results showed that each participant created a functional workspace (if one did not already exist), and successfully performed their paid employment at home. Despite the difficulties\u2014some resulting from the pandemic\u2014that complicated WFH, almost every woman wanted to continue working remotely in some capacity. The findings suggest that remote work is a viable labor model for women who want to combine paid and unpaid labor in a WFH nexus within the dwelling.

Moreover, there is a lack of evidence as to whether existing occupational health management (OHM) measures meet the needs of employees working in new forms of work. Methods/Design: This prospective mixed-method project will include four substudies to identify different NW forms, resulting health risk, benefits and protective factors in subgroups, and derive target group-specific OHM services. In the four substudies, the following methods will be used: (1) a scoping review, semi-standardized interviews, and an online survey, (2) a systematic review, an online survey, an expert workshop and qualitative interviews, (3) workplace observations, and (4) expert workshops. Recommendations for action will be derived from the findings of all substudies and summarized in a checklist for OHM in NW settings. Conclusion: Findings will expand the state of knowledge about NW settings and associated health effects. The development of an evidence-based checklist for target group-specific identification of NW settings and associated health risks, benefits and protective factors can be used as a basis for action regarding OHM in companies.

A total of 55 office workers from academic institutions in Belgium (n\u00a0=\u00a029) and Slovenia (n\u00a0=\u00a026) were included and 3665 item measurements were analysed. Participants were asked approximately every 90\u00a0min about their appraisal of stressful events (experienced during the working day) and their coping styles. For data analysis, we used an unstructured covariance matrix in our linear mixed models. Challenge appraisal predicted problem-focused coping and threat appraisal predicted emotion-focused coping. Our findings suggest an association between threat appraisal as well as challenge appraisal and seeking social support. Younger and female workers chose social support more often as a coping style. While working from home, participants were less likely to seek social support. The findings of our EMA study confirm previous research on the relationship between stress appraisal and coping with stress.

Many companies are implementing the Work From Home (WFH) system. This can cause a dilemma for the workforce due to the assumption that home is a place to rest, not to work. The benefits can be felt since the implementation of Work From Home (WFH). However, there are also negative impacts can be felt by the workforce due to disturbances outside of work. Conflicts between families are also common. The purpose of this study is to determine the strong relationship between marital status and mental workload with work stress in Work From Home (WFH) workers. Methods: This study is a survey research and used a cross-sectional study. The sample in this study is total population of workers in the Group of Digital BolaSport Kompas Gramedia Jakarta, which is 20 people. The variables used in this study were marital status, mental workload, and work stress. The data in this study were obtained by filling out questionnaires about individual characteristic (marital status), mental workload, and work stress. Results: Most of the workers have not married status (60%), high mental workload (55%), and medium work stress (55%). The correlation coefficient value between marital status and work stress is 0.373. Meanwhile, between mental workload and work stress it is 0.667. Conclusion: In Work From Home workers, there is a weak relationship between marital status and work stress. Besides that, there is a strong relationship between mental workload and work stress.", "venue": "The Indonesian Journal of Occupational Safety and Health", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 34, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://e-journal.unair.ac.id/IJOSH/article/download/28947/25543", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Sociology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-03", "journal": {"name": "The Indonesian Journal of Occupational Safety and Health"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Sinta2023RelationshipBM,\n author = {Lydia Elsa Sinta and Endang Dwiyanti},\n booktitle = {The Indonesian Journal of Occupational Safety and Health},\n journal = {The Indonesian Journal of Occupational Safety and Health},\n title = {Relationship between Marital Status and Mental Workload with Work Stress for Work From Home Workers},\n year = {2023}\n}\n"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2170957879", "name": "Lydia Elsa Sinta"}, {"authorId": "2082775803", "name": "Endang Dwiyanti"}]}, {"paperId": "33a863b31696c8c5c4cbb180daa1e323eb4e4b9c", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.32890/jbma2023.13.2.3", "CorpusId": 261157331}, "corpusId": 261157331, "publicationVenue": {"id": "2c25fed3-e92f-4b34-a7c1-aa5e6964d42f", "name": "Journal of Business Management and Accounting", "type": "journal", "alternate_names": ["J Bus Manag Account", "Journal of Business, Management, and Accounting"], "issn": "2231-9298", "alternate_issns": ["2714-870X"], "url": "http://www.imbre.uum.edu.my/index.php/journal/12-publications/297-previous-issues", "alternate_urls": ["https://e-journal.stie-kusumanegara.ac.id/index.php/jobma"]}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/33a863b31696c8c5c4cbb180daa1e323eb4e4b9c", "title": "EXPLORING THE DRIVERS OF WORKING FROM HOME PREFERENCES DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC AMONG ENGINEERS IN MANUFACTURING COMPANY", "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic has changed and forced many parties, including individuals and business organizations, to alter their lifestyles, business patterns and working arrangement.

All sectors, industries, organisations, and more importantly, people were affected by multiple restrictions implemented by their respective governing bodies. Federal lockdowns and all the emerging laws and regulations associated with them have forced organisations worldwide to transition their operations to remote environments. The implications from the organisations\u2019 perspective vary from leadership to management, structure to operations, and training and development to policy making. However, from the employees\u2019 perspective, the implications vary from general well-being to work engagement, satisfaction to motivation, and followership to trust. Nonetheless, remote work has other implications, such as productivity, the impact of social distancing, work-life balance, and isolation concerns. Therefore, this article aims to present critical thinking and comprehensively analyse the existing literature on remote working, transformational leadership, and work engagement contexts. Theoretical and practical gaps are discussed, and recommendations for future research could contribute to our better understanding of remote leadership and its practical elements.

Since many variables are involved in determining the relationships between telework and well-being, this paper clarifies the role of teleworkability, employees\u2019 preference for telework, and telework intensity; specifically, how the first two variables impact on well-being through telework intensity. A systematic review was carried out between 2012 and 2022 to analyze how these variables relate. Scarce literature connecting these subjects showed that teleworkability and the preference for telework influence the amount of time employees wish to telework. Teleworkability and preference for telework need to be studied from a multilevel perspective since country-, company-, and individual-level characteristics impact on them. The results also confirmed that telework intensity establishes direct relationships with well-being, and it is essential to predict it. Hybrid work emerged as a new concept which captures the best combination between on-site work and telework. Based on their employees\u2019 preferences, companies can introduce \u201chybrid-work flexible programs\u201d to maximize its positive effects on well-being as well as being able to re-design their jobs to better fit their employees\u2019 levels of telework expectations.", "venue": "Sustainability", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 71, "citationCount": 5, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/13/10631/pdf?version=1688609071", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-05", "journal": {"name": "Sustainability"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Urien2023TeleworkabilityPF,\n author = {Bego\u00f1a Urien},\n booktitle = {Sustainability},\n journal = {Sustainability},\n title = {Teleworkability, Preferences for Telework, and Well-Being: A Systematic Review},\n year = {2023}\n}\n"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "90215588", "name": "Bego\u00f1a Urien"}]}, {"paperId": "d0b24ee403d52d5f60cfaf92d42dd2c6bff3e40a", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/chiwork/XuSR23", "DOI": "10.1145/3596671.3598569", "CorpusId": 262064566}, "corpusId": 262064566, "publicationVenue": {"id": "99421402-eae3-4041-a27c-5982173d4db0", "name": "Symposium on Human-Computer Interaction for Work", "type": "conference", "alternate_names": ["CHIWORK", "Symp Human-computer Interact Work"], "url": "https://dl.acm.org/conference/chiwork"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0b24ee403d52d5f60cfaf92d42dd2c6bff3e40a", "title": "Is a Return To Office a Return To Creativity?

One concern arising from this transition is the cost to creativity in an environment of variable co-presence. We interviewed 24 researchers from several disciplines and varying levels of seniority, across 7 research labs in academia and industry about their hybrid work patterns and sources of creativity. Co-present \u2018brainstorming\u2019 and serendipitous \u2018watercooler\u2019 conversations are both often cited as arguments for mandating co-located work patterns in research organisations. Contrary to the dominant account which associates co-presence with increased creativity, we find that the flexibility of hybrid work, and carefully managed co-present interactions punctuating a regime of focused individual work, is the main catalyst of creativity. We find that the \u2018problem-oriented discussion\u2019 over time is a more powerful pattern for researcher collaboration than the \u2018brainstorm\u2019, that these discussions benefit greatly from the freedom to choose work locations afforded by hybrid work. We also find that serendipitous \u2018watercooler\u2019 conversations, while reported as valuable for collegiality, are reported as less valued for their contribution to creativity.

Work-life balance represents an essential need of remote workers, which could either be hindered or promoted during remote work. The continuous adoption of remote work warrants that the crucial challenge of work-life balance facing remote workers be addressed. Therefore, this study offers insights regarding the work-life balance processes of remote workers by following a research approach that involves synthesizing literature about remote work and work-life balance in an integrative way. This article upholds that the work-life balance processes of remote workers involve a work-life cognitive system that is responsible for maintaining equilibrium in the work-life system. The work-life system of remote workers includes elements, resources, forces, useful work, and output. Achieving balance between work and non-work domains is a function of the relative processes among the elements, resources, and forces within the work-life system. This article refers to the work-life balance cognitive system as \u2018the work-life balance machine\u2019. The work-life balance machine provides knowledge about how and what remote workers need to learn, adapt to, and change in the environment in order to develop an optimally balanced work and life. Thus, based on the blending of theories and concepts with the synthesized evidence from literature, this article offers a model; the work-life balance machine and a definition of work-life balance.

However, we do not know yet what benefits and drawbacks the metaverse has as a legitimate workspace, because there are few real cases of 1) working in the metaverse and 2) working remotely at such an unprecedented scale. Thus, this paper aims to identify real challenges and opportunities the metaverse workspace presents when compared to remote work by conducting semi-structured interviews and participatory workshops with various employees and company stakeholders (e.g., HR managers and CEOs) who have experienced at least two of three work types: working in a physical office, remotely, or in the metaverse.

While there was no significant association with participants' perceptions of teamwork, results revealed associations of work location with team conflict: participants who worked in a private room at home reported significantly lower team conflict compared to those working in the office. No difference was found for the office and the shared workspace. We further found that the influence of work location on team conflict interacted with job decision latitude and the level of task interdependence among co-workers.

While individualised programmes are usually the preferred option, they can be more costly and challenging to deliver in person. A move to digital programmes with a wider reach has commenced, and demand has increased due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this review, we evaluate the current status of digital exercise programme delivery and its evolution over the past decade, with a focus on personalisation. We used specific keywords to search for articles that met our predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria in order to provide valuable evidence and insights for future research. We identified 55 studies in total in four key areas of focus, from the more recent development of apps and personal digital assistants to web-based programmes and text or phone call interventions.

Methods A cross-sectional study with a retrospective assessment was conducted early in 2022 at the National Research Council of Italy. Five single-item questions explored the perceived impact on life domain while a 7-item scale the impact on the work domain. Bivariate analyses and multivariate regressions were used to evaluate the associations between impacts and some key factors defined by 29 ad hoc closed questions. Results More than 95% of the 748 respondents reported a perceived change in at least one item of the life domain. For each of these items, although a large group of subjects has reported that working from home had no impact (from 27 to 55%), in the rest of the sample the positive evaluation (from 30 to 60%) clearly prevailed over the negative one. Overall, most of the subjects (64%) rated the impact on the work experience positively. Relationship with colleagues and participation in the work context were the items where the greatest number of negative rates was concentrated (27 and 25%, respectively). On the other hand, positive perceptions prevailed over both negative perceptions and lack of impact perceptions on the subjects of organizational flexibility and quality of work. The frequency of work-room sharing, home-work commute time and changes in sedentary lifestyle, have been identified as common explanatory factors of perceived impacts on both domains. Conclusion Overall, respondents reported positive rather than negative perceived impacts of forced work from home in both their lives and work. The obtained results suggest that policies to promote the physical and mental health of employees, strengthen inclusion and maintain a sense of community are necessary to improve workers' health and prevent the effects of perceived isolation on research activities.", "venue": "Frontiers in Public Health", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 74, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1151009/pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Sociology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-10", "journal": {"volume": "11", "name": "Frontiers in Public Health"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Bodini2023TheMP,\n author = {A.

However, there is limited evidence on clients\u2019 evaluation of specific frontline services and the role of technology. This study takes advantage of a unique multi-year course evaluation dataset in higher education in China to elucidate the effect of teleworking on clients\u2019 perception of frontline services. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020, Chinese universities were forced to turn the in-person courses into online courses, which provided an excellent opportunity to identify the exogenous effect of technological shock.

This paper provides a critical reflection of the researcher\u2019s experience of conducting interviews with survivors of trauma while working from home. The research aimed to understand the experiences of significant others supporting patients with severe burn injury in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). As an experienced ICU nurse, the researcher has well developed personal coping strategies for dealing with complex trauma and in working with significant others of patients with severe burn injury in hospital settings. Due to the pandemic, data collection moved from face-to-face in the hospital, as originally intended, to phone or videoconference interviews. 17 participants were recruited, with all participants given the option of videoconference (n = 3) or telephone interviews (n = 14). Interviews had an average length of 55 minutes. This paper discusses the strategies adopted to cope with the sharing of significant others\u2019 experiences of trauma while in the home environment.

Our findings reveal that there are some employees well suited to working from home, while others are less enthusiastic about this initiative, and that a significant factor is household caregiving responsibilities, often considered to be the domain of women. Our insights shed light on differences in caregiver-employee statuses; we hope to help guide effective institutional policy should there be a need for workplaces to shut down again and to encourage administrators to consider faculty who may be a good work from home fit should it be considered for everyday work.

Quantitative research was conducted to achieve the stated purpose using the survey method, the number of respondents being 1098 persons. The research tool was an online questionnaire. Results highlight how telework affected each generation of employees. The satisfaction towards teleworking achieved by Generation Z and Baby Boomers is, on average, higher than that of Generation Y and X. The differences between the age groups (Generation Z, Y, X, and Baby Boomers) in terms of telework satisfaction levels were also tested, considering each of the three aspects examined and presented in the article\u2019s title. At the conceptual level, research brings a new methodological approach as an element of originality that can be used for similar future research. Moreover, new concepts on the effects of telework on employees were connected and analysed simultaneously: work-life balance, productivity, and health of employees during teleworking.

Analysis of survey revealed the importance of type of residence in affecting satisfaction of functionality and well-being.FindingsThe collected demographic variables played a crucial role in affecting satisfaction with various elements, from indoor air quality of the working space to the amount of natural light received by the space. Finally, participants who felt the need to add color and change furniture layout, experienced feelings of productivity, commitment and motivation by working from home. The same participants decided to keep the amended changes to their living spaces, even after they return to working from their offices. The study concludes by presenting implications of this experience on future home designs; thereby offering suggestions of authorities, and designers to produce more flexible and resilient houses.Research limitations/implicationsA relatively small sample with limited professions was considered. Further research recommendations include increasing the sample size to target more categories of the residents of the UAE. Future research can expand the criteria used to evaluate satisfaction and include noise levels as well as accessibility.Practical implicationsThe study offers suggestions to authorities and designers to produce more flexible and resilient homes, taking demographics into consideration. Roof gardens, shading devices and privacy needs are crucial elements for the future home.Originality/valueThe research provides enough information to inform designers about the future of space interiors, how well they are configured, serviced and how adaptable they are, in order to enhance user satisfaction.HighlightsSatisfaction was affected by individual differences.Those who changed furniture layout showed least average satisfaction.Females reported higher satisfaction with indoor air quality and lighting than males.", "venue": "Engineering Construction and Architectural Management", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 41, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Sociology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-10", "journal": {"name": "Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Hiyasat2022UseOW,\n author = {Rund Hiyasat and Marco Sosa and Lina Ahmad},\n booktitle = {Engineering Construction and Architectural Management},\n journal = {Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management},\n title = {Use of work-space at home under COVID-19 conditions in the UAE},\n year = {2022}\n}\n"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "107966007", "name": "Rund Hiyasat"}, {"authorId": "2073659667", "name": "Marco Sosa"}, {"authorId": "100961444", "name": "Lina Ahmad"}]}, {"paperId": "47aa646547f35d9a1cf66d9b198c0d8bdd1465dd", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s11115-022-00667-0", "CorpusId": 252842644}, "corpusId": 252842644, "publicationVenue": {"id": "98dcef62-5659-4c03-bc5e-f1bc218286a7", "name": "Public Organization Review", "type": "journal", "alternate_names": ["Public Organ Rev"], "issn": "1566-7170", "url": "https://link.springer.com/journal/11115"}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/47aa646547f35d9a1cf66d9b198c0d8bdd1465dd", "title": "Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde?

This study was designed to determine the prevalence of burnout among academics in the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), Kuantan campus, and the associated sociodemographic and occupational-related factors. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study between March and May 2021 using questionnaires adapted from Copenhagen Burnout Inventory and General Stressor Questionnaire at the IIUM, Kuantan campus. Results: 57 clinical and 93 non-clinical academics responded to the survey. The prevalence of significant burnout was 49%. Compared to non-clinical academics, clinical academics had a significantly higher proportion of burnout with a p-value of <0.001, particularly in work-related, student-related, and superior-related burnout domains, with a p-value of 0.004, <0.001, and 0.006, respectively. Factors significantly associated with burnout among our cohort were clinical work, chronic illness, and gender, each with an odds ratio of 2.72 (95% CI = 1.01,7.34), 2.81 (95% CI = 1.14, 6.92), and 4.86 (95% CI = 2.15, 10.9). Conclusion: Burnout was highly prevalent among academics in the IIUM Kuantan campus, particularly among clinical academics during the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of remote teaching and learning policy.", "venue": "MEANDCOVID19", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 30, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-10", "journal": {"name": "MEANDCOVID19"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Ayub2022BurnoutAC,\n author = {Izzudeen Ayub and Muhd Alwi Muhd Helmi and Nur Syuhada Mohd Azhar and Nurul Fauwiza Mohd Fauzi and Mai Nurul Ashikin Taib and M.

An online survey was conducted among faculty, staff, and students at universities in 24 countries (n = 674). The results show that over 80% of the respondents used multiple coping methods. Three clusters of coping methods were generated through factor analysis: (1) social and health factor, with focus on personal health and the social surrounding, (2) activity factor, i.e., being busy with work or studies, finding up-to-date information about COVID-19, while thinking about what one could do rather than what one could not do, and (3) public health factor, which meant trusting health authorities while avoiding misinformation from sources such as social media. Furthermore, 56% of the respondents were very or somewhat satisfied with working from home. Differences in the methods of coping and satisfaction with working from home highlight the need for employers to prepare for working from home beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.", "venue": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 66, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/19/12669/pdf?version=1665301915", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Sociology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "journal": {"volume": "19", "name": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Munobwa2022CopingMA,\n author = {J.

This was especially true for early-stage faculty (ESF), many of whom had caregiving responsibilities. In addition, women faculty, underrepresented in medicine and science faculty, and particularly ESF experienced marked declines in research productivity, which significantly impacts career trajectories. When combined with staffing shortages due to an aging workforce and suboptimal recruitment and retention in ID, these work-life imbalances have brought the field to an inflection point. We propose actionable recommendations and call on ID leaders to act to close the gender, racial, and ethnic gaps to improve the recruitment, retention, and advancement of ESF in ID. By investing in systemic change to make the ID workforce more equitable, we can embody the shared ideals of diversity and inclusion and prepare for the next pandemic.", "venue": "Clinical Infectious Diseases", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 45, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/76/4/753/49255988/ciac779.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-22", "journal": {"name": "Clinical Infectious Diseases: An Official Publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Scherer2022TheCP,\n author = {E.

People performing typical office activities provided with a laptop and an internet connection can work in whatever place: a coffee house, a waiting room of a train station, an airport, or their own home. The habit to work at home has amazingly spread due to the Covid-19 pandemic, arising crucial questions. Are home work-stations comfortable enough to work? Are lighting conditions of residential spaces proper to perform typical office activities? This paper presents a survey investigating the typical characteristics of the luminous environment in home working spaces (considering both daylight and electric light) and people\u2019s average awareness about light and lighting-connected themes. The research has been carried out through an online questionnaire addressed to home workers and students forced to stay home because of the Covid-19 spread. The results demonstrated that many interviewees have difficulties in managing light and are not completely aware of the right actions to take to improve lighting quality of home workplaces. Moreover, a complete lack of knowledge about electric light has emerged. So, popularizing more knowledge about light and lighting-connected themes is prominent. Indeed, now and even more in the future, people will work in places other than the traditional workplaces, for which standards regulating lighting characteristics do not exist. In this context, the definition of ad hoc guidelines and the spread of best practices should be a crucial goal for researchers and experts in lighting.", "venue": "Journal of Daylighting", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 38, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://solarlits.com/jd/pdf/9-177.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Engineering", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-07", "journal": {"name": "Journal of Daylighting"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Bellia2022LightingQS,\n author = {L.

The study, guided by the SWOT analysis as the theoretical framework, was located within the qualitative research paradigm. It leveraged a sample of ten academics drawn from the Faculty of Education at a rural-based university using a purposive sampling technique. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview and analysis was thematically performed. The findings revealed that WFH arrangements offered opportunities for working from home without incurring the cost of travelling, saved commuting time, provided new ways of teaching and learning with evolving digital platforms, and allowed for prioritising of time for self-development and relaxation. WFH challenges included social isolation, disconnection from colleagues, fatigue from performing monotonous routines daily, inadequate data, and poor internet connectivity. Thus, the study recommends the provision of internet facility support and technological training of academic staff of universities on innovative and pedagogical approaches to teaching and learning for blended and/or online teaching in preparation for any similar disruption of education in the future.", "venue": "International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 28, "citationCount": 9, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter/article/download/5202/pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Economics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-07-30", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Badaru2022TeachingIA,\n author = {Kazeem Ajasa Badaru and K.

In South Africa, the government-forced lockdown measures and social distancing containment policy changed working arrangements across sectors and organisations. As a result, academics were forced to work from home (WFH), a task for which they were hardly prepared. Several researchers have engaged the WFH situation of academics to understand the relationship between WFH and productivity. As far as we know, very few studies have tried to describe academics\u2019 WFH experiences in relation to the challenges, including determining possible ways of improving their satisfaction with working from home. We examine in this article the experiences of academics working from home across selected universities in South Africa. Using a qualitative approach and applying Atlas.ti for data analysis, our findings show that working from home in academia is a daunting task requiring extensive organisational, personal, and social adjustments. The population comprised all academics irrespective of any demographic or personality characteristic within the management faculty of the participating universities. Five themes\u2014inability to adapt, lack of a home office, loneliness and isolation, inability to balance family and work, and improving satisfaction with work from home\u2014were identified as significant variables from the participants\u2019 responses. Our analysis suggests that organisations need to customise approaches to engage with the experiences of academics who work from home during COVID-19 and to develop fit-for-purpose support for these academics.

Little investigation has been done into the influence of other workspace characteristics (i.e. temperature, amount of space, visual privacy, adjustability of furniture, wall colours, and workspace cleanliness) on distractions at the office, and even fewer while working from home (WFH). The influence of home-workspace distractions on mental health also received limited attention. This research aims to investigate relationships between home-workspace and personal characteristics, distraction, and mental health while WFH during COVID-19. A path analysis approach was used, to find that, at home, employees were distracted by noise and when having a small desk. Those with a dedicated workroom were less distracted. Distractions mediated most relationships between home-workspace characteristics and mental health, while personal characteristics influenced mental health directly. Employers can use these results to redesign policies regarding home-and-office working to stimulate a healthy work environment. Practitioner summary: The investigation of the influence of home-workspace characteristics on distractions and mental health while WFH during COVID-19 appears to be limited. This research filled this gap by performing a path analysis, using a holistic definition of mental health.

COVID-19 findings", "abstract": "In these times of successive lockdown periods due to the health crisis induced by COVID-19, this paper investigates how the usages of collaborative and communication digital tools (groupware, workflow, instant messaging and web conference) are related to the evolution of teleworkers\u2019 subjective well-being (job satisfaction, job stress) and job productivity comparing during and before the first lockdown in spring 2020. Using a sample of 438 employees working for firms located in Luxembourg, this analysis enables, first, to highlight different profiles of teleworkers regarding the evolution of usages of these tools during the lockdown compared to before and the frequency of use during. Second, the analysis highlights that these profiles are linked to the evolution of job satisfaction, job stress and job productivity. Our main results show that (1) the profile that generates an increase in job productivity is the one with a combined mastered daily or weekly use of all of the four studied digital tools but at the expense of job satisfaction. On the contrary, (2) the use of the four digital tools both before and during the lockdown, associated with an increase in the frequency of use, appears to generate too much information flow to deal with and teleworkers may suffer from information overload that increases their stress and reduces their job satisfaction and job productivity.

It also explored the role of gender, education level, and job position in the relationship between specifications and facilities when working from home, as well as attitudes and perceptions. This study is exploratory and capitalizes on novel findings from a questionnaire. Data were collected from 399 employees employed by the principal Saudi businesses. The current study uses structural equation modeling to test the research hypotheses and examines the direct and indirect relationship between working from home and employees\u2019 job performance. The results confirmed the significant direct linkage between WFH and employees\u2019 job performance through the mediating roles of WFH employees\u2019 attitudes and perceptions. Our findings also confirm the significant relationship between WFH employees\u2019 attributes and their job performance, and the significant association between WFH and job performance. However, our results identified the fact that perceptions have an inverse impact on job performance. This study also provides significant theoretical and practical insights for managers who are adopting WFH. It contributes empirically to the literature by informing managers of the factors driving job performance in WFH, helping organizations to cope with the many issues related to a workforce who are working from home. Our research findings also ascertained that WFH seems likely to become a permanent managerial practice in terms of human resources, rather than a simple circumstantial measure.

In the process, the shift to working-from-home rapidly forced the large-scale adoption of groupware technologies. Although prior empirical research examined the experience of working-from-home within small-scale groups and for targeted kinds of work, the pandemic provides HCI and CSCW researchers with an unprecedented opportunity to understand the psycho-social impacts of a universally mandated work-from-home experience rather than an autonomously chosen one. Drawing on boundary theory and a methodological approach grounded in humanistic geography, we conducted a qualitative analysis of Reddit data drawn from two work-from-home-related subreddits between March 2020 and January 2021. In this paper, we present a characterization of the challenges and solutions discussed within these online communities for adapting work to a hybrid or fully remote modality, managing reconfigured work-life boundaries, and reconstructing the home's sense of place to serve multiple, sometimes conflicting roles. We discuss how these findings suggest an emergent interplay among adapted work practice, reimagined physical (and virtual) spaces, and the establishment and continual re-negotiation of boundaries as a means for anticipating the long-term impact of COVID on future conceptualizations of productivity and work.", "venue": "Proc.

The use of information and communication technologies has been identified in the literature not only as affecting the levels felt by employees in terms of their relation to work (organisational commitment and recognition for work accomplished) but also in terms of work-life balance and health (stress and addictions). However, these studies are few in number when it comes to nomadic and informal work practices and rarely address perceived social approval in employees\u2019 professional entourage. We used an empirical study based on a questionnaire survey. The results indicate that employees favour smartphone and laptop use. The effects of perceived social approval in their professional entourage differ according to the technologies used. These uses also have an impact on commitment and recognition, but their effects on employees\u2019 perception of the effects of work life on \u201cnon-work\u201d life and on addiction-related behaviours are more nuanced.

Although WFH was a fantasy for many employees prior to the pandemic and offered some advantages, it has proven to be a difficult work arrangement for most telecommuters during this pandemic situation. Objective: Considering the challenges experienced by telecommuters and to improve their well-being, this article reviews some of the challenges experienced by telecommuters in a pandemic situation. The impact of personal resources such as self-efficacy and flow on Work Life Balance (WLB) were also reviewed. Besides that, influential WLB theories were also reviewed. Design: Relevant work life balance and well-being articles published before and after the pandemic between 1990 to 2021 were identified for review using appropriate keywords. Results: WFH has many benefits, but when implemented in a forced manner in a pandemic situation, employees experienced blurred boundaries, leading to poor WLB. Resources such as self-efficacy and flow can help telecommuters deal with this unprecedented crisis in a more regulated, calm and positive manner. Review of theories and literatures contributed to the development of a Crisis Induced Resources and Balance/Conflict Framework. Conclusions: Pandemic situation has worsened work life balance of telecommuters who struggle in creating and maintaining the boundary between work and home. However, telecommuters can learn to regulate themselves more effectively and manage their boundary with others. Government and companies can communicate better WFH guidelines, policies and also show support to their workers during this crisis.", "venue": "International Journal of Academic Research in Accounting, Finance and Management Sciences", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 41, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-08-20", "journal": {"name": "International Journal of Academic Research in Accounting, Finance and Management Sciences"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Chandrasekaran2021ConceptualRO,\n author = {Khartikka Chandrasekaran and F.

Academics in many African countries were recently required to resume work while observing social distancing protocols. Physical inactivity (PI) was, therefore, expected to increase in such academics. Interestingly, walkable neighbourhoods are resources that could discourage excessive sitting and PI in this situation. This study, therefore, assessed the moderating role of neighbourhood walkability in the relationship between core job components (i.e. on-site teaching, online teaching, research and student assessment) and PA among academics. The study adopted a cross-sectional design that utilized an online survey hosted by Google Forms to gather data. Participants were volunteer full-time academics in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and Tanzania. A total of 1064 surveys were analysed, with a sensitivity analysis utilized to select covariates for the ultimate hierarchical linear regression model. After controlling for the ultimate covariates (e.g. gender, education and income), PA was found to be positively associated with the job component 'research work\u2019 but negatively associated with student assessment. Neighbourhood walkability increased the positive relationship of research work with PA and reduced the negative relationship of student assessment with PA. The non-significant negative relationship between \u2018teaching online\u2019 and PA was made positively significant by neighbourhood walkability. We conclude that research as a job component is positively associated with PA, but online teaching is negatively associated with PA among African academics in a post-COVID-19 context.", "venue": "Health Promotion International", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 53, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article-pdf/37/2/daab090/43511598/daab090.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Sociology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-07-19", "journal": {"volume": "37", "name": "Health Promotion International"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Asiamah2021TheRB,\n author = {N.

All interviews were arranged in advance and took place in an informal atmosphere, most often in a home environment. The interviews were recorded on a recording device with the consent of the respondents, for the possibility of data processing and subsequent analysis. The selection of respondents was carried out by the method of intentional selection. The research sample involved ninety respondents who had specific experience with working from home, which meant that they currently used work from home, i.e., home office as a benefit, standard or primary place of work. One interview was conducted with each respondent in the time range of 25 to 35 minutes.\nFindings \u2013 Within the research, several areas were confirmed, which are mentioned by various authors in the theoretical part of the presented paper. There is a positive perception of home office employees in the area of saving time, or the feeling of freedom. In the negative case, and thus potentially demotivating, phenomena of employees in the area of social isolation was most significantly confirmed. The issue of procrastination mentioned by the respondents in several cases could also be mentioned as confirmatory and existing in-home office. The frustration with low home office efficiency was not mentioned by the respondents, on the contrary, some stated that they found their work from home more efficient than in the office. The results of the presented research show that it would be a mistake to look at the home office only from one side.\nNovelty - Although it could be said that the positives of this type of work performance to motivate employees outweigh the negatives, this ratio may vary significantly from employee to employee, especially depending on the specific and current conditions, which may also change significantly within the time.

This overview finds that most early meta-research on COVID-19 has been reactive and focused on short-term questions, while more recently a shift to consider the long-term consequences of COVID-19 is taking place. Based on these findings, the author speculates that some aspects of doing research during COVID-19 are more likely to persist than others.

We argue that the link between WFH and the perception of changes to one\u2019s career prospects is likely to differ depending on gender, occupation, whether the employee has worked from home before the pandemic, how much time their children spent at home due to pandemic restrictions and the cohabiting status of the parent. We conducted fixed effects multinomial regression models using a unique multicountry dataset, including representative samples of parents with dependent children from Canada, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the US. Employees with children who had prior experience with WFH before the pandemic were more likely to report improved career prospects than those who worked solely in the office. The positive effect of WFH for newcomers to the world of remote work was less unequivocal and varied based on occupation and gender. We also find that the presence of children at home and the cohabitation status substantially moderate the link between WFH and perceived changes to one\u2019s career prospects, with different implications based on the employee's gender. We fill the research gap by showing how fluid workers' perceptions of career prospects depend on varying professional (prior experience with WFH and occupation) and personal (increased family demands) situations.

We surveymore than 30,000 Americans over multiple waves to investigate whether WFH will stick, and why. Our data say that 20 percent of full workdays will be supplied from home after the pandemic ends, compared with just 5 percent before. We develop evidence on five reasons for this large shift: better-than-expected WFH experiences, new investments in physical and human capital that enable WFH, greatly diminished stigma associated with WFH, lingering concerns about crowds and contagion risks, and a pandemic-driven surge in technological innovations that support WFH. We also use our survey data to project three consequences: First, employees will enjoy large benefits from greater remote work, especially those with higher earnings. Second, the shift to WFH will directly reduce spending in major city centers by at least 5-10 percent relative to the pre-pandemic situation. Third, our data on employer plans and the relative productivity of WFH imply a 5 percent productivity boost in the post-pandemic economy due to re-optimized working arrangements. Only one-fifth of this productivity gain will show up in conventional productivity measures, because they do not capture the time savings from less commuting.", "venue": "Social Science Research Network", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 88, "citationCount": 594, "influentialCitationCount": 61, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/113912/1/dp1790.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Business", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Economics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Sociology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-12-02", "journal": {"name": "SSRN Electronic Journal"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Barrero2020WhyWF,\n author = {Jose Maria Barrero and N.

In this study, we report the findings of a survey investigating the rapid transition to emergency remote teaching in the early weeks of the pandemic at public and private post-secondary institutions in the United States. Participants consisted of 897 faculty and administrators at 672 U.S. institutions. Findings reveal that with few exceptions nearly all reporting institutions transitioned to emergency teaching and learning approaches. Administrators reported that faculty with and without online teaching experience pivoted to online teaching, and nearly all administrators indicated that those who did not have online teaching experience were in the process of learning how to teach online. Regardless of whether faculty had previous experience teaching online or not, many faculty reported that they were using new teaching methods. A majority of faculty reported making changes to their assignments or exams as a result of transitioning to a new mode of delivery. Nearly half reported lowering the expected volume of work for students (including dropping assignments or exams) and/or shifting to a pass/fail model for this semester. The primary areas where faculty and administrators identified a need for assistance related to student support, greater access to online digital materials, and guidance for working from home. This study provides an early snapshot of efforts towards teaching and learning continuity at a large scale and provides some insights for future research and practice.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 19, "citationCount": 367, "influentialCitationCount": 34, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://olj.onlinelearningconsortium.org/index.php/olj/article/download/2285/930", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Education", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-06-01", "journal": {"volume": "24", "pages": "6-21", "name": ""}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Johnson2020USFA,\n author = {Nicole Johnson and G.

Such changes to work represent a reconfiguration of the spatial separation and relationship between place of work and place of residence. Through homeworking, this paper studies how changing geographies of work and workplaces impact on workers\u2019 life satisfaction overall and across various aspects of their lives. Using a large representative longitudinal dataset for the United Kingdom, findings reveal that workers\u2019 satisfaction with their job, income and leisure time is significantly shaped by homeworking and that the employment status (employee versus self-employed) and gender are important elements for understanding how homeworking is related to subjective well-being. Homeworking is positively related with leisure time satisfaction of men and women. Job satisfaction advances of homeworking are only observed for employees, but not the self-employed. Men\u2019s income satisfaction is decreased when they work as self-employed without employees in their homes.

The aim of this systematic literature review is to gain a deeper understanding of the association between remote e-working, within knowledge workers, and the five dimensions of well-being at work: affective, cognitive, social, professional, and psychosomatic. Sixty-three studies employing quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method designs have been included in the review. Findings indicate that we know more about remote e-workers\u2019 affective state and their social and professional life than we know about their cognitive functioning and psychosomatic conditions. Whilst the research indicates a positive focus there are some negative aspects of this way of working which are highlighted within this review; such as social and professional isolation, and perceived threats in professional advancement.

Drawing on existing literature on telecommuting and the outcome of a valuation study on the success of an experimental telecommuting programme at the largest distance education institution in South Africa, this article presents discerning findings on telecommuting practices. In fact, the research builds on evolutionary telecommuting assessment methods of the direct or indirect effect (work based) and affective impact (emotional) on multiple stakeholder groups. This holistic approach allowed for comparative analysis between telecommuting and nontelecommuting academics with regard to the impact of telecommuting practices. The research reveals high levels of support for telecommuting practices that are associated with high levels of work productivity and satisfaction, lower levels of emotional and physical fatigue, and reduced work stress, frustration, and overload. The study also reveals higher levels of student satisfaction with academic support from telecommuters than nontelecommuters. Overall, the critique presents insightful findings on telecommuting practices within an academic setting, which clearly signal a potential for a shift in the office culture of higher distance education institutions in the years to come.

The present study examined the influence of FFPs, work-family culture, and family characteristics on salient job outcomes, and multiple dimensions of work-family conflict (WFC) and family-work conflict (FWC). Results from a survey of 564 workers, indicate that FFPs exert minimal effects on felt conflict, and that a positive work-family culture and family support may be more instrumental in helping employees balance work and home roles. Findings also suggest that sources of conflict varied among workers, as did the mechanisms used to address WFC and FWC. This study underscores the importance of examining WFC as a multi-dimensional phenomenon affecting employees in a variety of family structures, as well as considering the impact of FFPs in conjunction with work-family culture.

It relied on 93 semi-structured interviews with telecommuters, non-telecommuters, and their respective supervisors in two high technology firms and two city governments. These organizations had active telecommuting programmes and a strong interest in making telecommuting a successful work option, providing an opportunity to investigate the challenges of telecommuting that existed even within friendly environments. The interviews demonstrated that professional isolation of telecommuters is inextricably linked to employee development activities (interpersonal networking, informal learning, and mentoring). The extent to which telecommuters experience professional isolation depends upon the extent to which these activities are valued in the workplace and the degree to which telecommuters miss these opportunities. Public respondents appeared to value these informal developmental activities less than private employees. Therefore, we stipulate that telecommuting is less likely to hinder the professional development of public sector employees than that of employees in the private sector.

Flexi-time, the most common FWA among men, has positive effects as it facilitates management of household responsibilities while maintaining full-time employment. Part-time and homeworking are also positive, consistent with men using FWAs with a greater degree of choice. Women more often are constrained in their use of FWAs, often into working reduced hours. Consequently, FWAs have negative impacts for some women, on job (part-time when used for extended periods, flexi-time), leisure (job-share, flexi-time), and life satisfaction (job-share).", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 54, "citationCount": 176, "influentialCitationCount": 6, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Sociology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Economics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Inproceedings{Wheatley2016UniversityOB,\n author = {Daniel Wheatley},\n title = {University of Birmingham Employee satisfaction and use of flexible working arrangements},\n year = {2016}\n}\n"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2241432843", "name": "Daniel Wheatley"}]}, {"paperId": "14eee5b0607ece493cda8eaf4757ac37554e6bce", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2626195662", "CorpusId": 157856025}, "corpusId": 157856025, "publicationVenue": null, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14eee5b0607ece493cda8eaf4757ac37554e6bce", "title": "Sixth European Working Conditions Survey \u2013 Overview Report", "abstract": "Since 1991, Eurofound has been monitoring working conditions in Europe through its European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS).

How do these consequences come about? When are these consequences more or less potent? The authors answer these questions through construction of a theoretical framework and meta-analysis of 46 studies in natural settings involving 12,883 employees. Telecommuting had small but mainly beneficial effects on proximal outcomes, such as perceived autonomy and (lower) work-family conflict. Importantly, telecommuting had no generally detrimental effects on the quality of workplace relationships. Telecommuting also had beneficial effects on more distal outcomes, such as job satisfaction, performance, turnover intent, and role stress. These beneficial consequences appeared to be at least partially mediated by perceived autonomy. Also, high-intensity telecommuting (more than 2.5 days a week) accentuated telecommuting's beneficial effects on work-family conflict but harmed relationships with coworkers. Results provide building blocks for a more complete theoretical and practical treatment of telecommuting.", "venue": "Journal of Applied Psychology", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": 169, "citationCount": 1774, "influentialCitationCount": 199, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["MetaAnalysis", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": {"volume": "92 6", "pages": "\n          1524-41\n        ", "name": "The Journal of applied psychology"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Gajendran2007TheGT,\n author = {Ravi S.
