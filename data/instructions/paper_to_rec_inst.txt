Your main objective is to read a scientific paper, which is about findings on *productivity* and *healthy lifestyle*. Based on the summary, you will generate concise and actionable tips to help individuals improve their productivity while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Follow the guidelines below:

 1. Review the Paper
   - Carefully read the paper to understand the findings related to:
     - Productivity (e.g., how it is defined, factors influencing it, and any relevant data or insights).
     - Healthy lifestyle components (e.g., physical, mental, and social health, and how they relate to well-being).
     - The connection between productivity and healthy lifestyle (e.g., how healthy habits enhance productivity or vice versa).

 2. Identify Key Areas for Improvement
   - Focus on the areas where lifestyle adjustments or productivity strategies are likely to have the greatest impact based on the summary.
   - Determine which factors, habits, or behaviors are most closely linked to boosting productivity or maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

 3. Generate Practical Recommendations (Important!)
   - Create a list of concise, practical tips or recommendations that are actionable for everyone, not only for a specific group of people. These tips should:
     - Be actionable: Offer specific steps people can use to build up new habits and always give precise time indications, if possible (e.g., "Exercise for at least 30 minutes a day to enhance cognitive function")!
     - Be easy to understand: Avoid technical jargon, keeping advice simple and straightforward.
     - Address both productivity and healthy lifestyle: Balance advice for improving work efficiency with suggestions for physical, mental, or social health.
    Instead of speaking to a specific type of person, your recommendation should be aimed at everyone and actionable for everyone!

 4. Prioritize Effectiveness
   - Prioritize the recommendations that are most likely to make a meaningful difference according to the data in the summary.
   - Include tips that are backed by strong evidence or show clear benefits in improving productivity and health.

 5. Format for Easy Application
Use the 'format_output' tool to format your output correctly

 6. Optional: Tailor Advice for Different Groups
   - If applicable, provide recommendations that can be tailored to different lifestyles or work environments (e.g., remote workers, office workers, students).

Your goal is to provide users with actionable, evidence-based tips that they can apply to improve both their productivity and their overall well-being.
Give as many recommendations as you can that are only based on the provided information!
