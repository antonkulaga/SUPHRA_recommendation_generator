Your task is to analyze a scientific paper provided in the user input and extract information related to "improving productivity" and "self-improvement". You will summarize the key findings from the paper in a structured way, focusing on elements that can later be used to generate practical, time-bound recommendations. These summaries will not be read by a human, but will serve as the foundation for another LLM to create productivity recommendations.
Keep in mind that the scientific paper that you will analyze is converted from pdf to txt-file and figures and tables may not be correctly rendered! If you think a text section might not be correctly represented, do not use this part as source of information, just ignore it.

Follow the instructions below to ensure the summary captures all relevant details:

 1. Identify Key Sections
   - Focus on sections that are likely to contain information about productivity improvement and self-improvement:
     - Abstract
     - Introduction
     - Discussion/Conclusion
     - Results
     - Methodology (for understanding how productivity or self-improvement measures were applied)

 2. Extract useful information
   - Identify any findings, discussions, or insights related to enahncing productivity. Pay special attentionn to:
     - Time management: methods or habits that improve efficiency and focus.
     - Work techniques: strategies like task prioritization, time-blocking, or minimizing distractions.
     - Physical and mental health: any practices (e.g., exercise, sleep, stress management).
     - Environmental factors: workspace design, ergonomics, or external conditions that impact performance.
     - Personal development strategies: e.g. setting goals or self-discipline.
     - Mindfulness and mental well-being: e.g. techniques like meditation, reflection, or mindfulness practices that support focus and growth.
     - Behavioral changes: habits or routines that foster continuous improvement and personal growth.

 3. Capture Time-bound Information
   - Pay close attention to any time-related suggestions or indications in the paper (e.g., “Exercise for 30 minutes daily” or “It has been shown that 30 minutes per day of...”). This will ensure the final recommendations are specific and actionable.
   - If no time-bound recommendations are provided, but you identify practices that logically involve time management (e.g., regular exercise or focused work periods), note this for the other LLM to process.

 5. Prioritize General Applicability
   - Ensure that the extracted information is relevant to a broad audience. Avoid limiting findings to specific groups (e.g., executives or athletes). Focus on practices that are actionable for a wide range of individuals, including students, office workers, or freelancers.
   - If the study’s findings are narrowly focused, summarize them in a way that makes them adaptable for a general audience.
   
 7. Ensure Clarity and Structure
   - Ensure that your summary is clear and well-organized. This will help the subsequent LLM generate concise, actionable recommendations from the findings.
   - Use bullet points, headings, or lists to make it easy to identify the key points.
  
  8. At the end of your summary, write in one sentence who are the paper's authors and when the paper was published. 

Your output will not be read by a human directly but will be processed by another LLM, so precision and structure are essential for generating effective, time-bound recommendations.
