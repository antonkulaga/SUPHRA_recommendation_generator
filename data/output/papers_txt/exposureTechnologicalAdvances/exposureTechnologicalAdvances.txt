Abstract

Objectives: The study objective was to measure the association between exposure to technological advances and work engagement,
adjusting for personal and workplace factors.

Methods: We conducted a nationwide online longitudinal survey study in Japan. The sample was stratified to represent Japanese
workforce conditions. Work engagement was measured using the Japanese version of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-9. Exposure to
technological advances was measured using a single question with Likert scale responses. Industry characteristics that were more/less
likely to be replaced by automation were also measured. Linear regression was used for statistical analysis.

Results: There were 16629 participants. We found that exposure to technological advances was associated with work engagement
after adjustment for age, sex, education, income, and industry characteristics. We observed a significant interaction between age
and exposure to technological advances (coefficient 0.891, P<.001), and conducted an age-stratified linear regression analysis.
The significant association between age and exposure to technological advances reduced as age increased, and disappeared after
adjustment for baseline work engagement.

Conclusions: Longitudinal observations showed that exposure to technological advances was not significantly associated with work
engagement.

Key points: What is already known on this topic

1) Exposure to technological advances likely contributes to negative outcomes such as job insecurity, poor health conditions, and
work-related injury or disease.

What this study adds

1) Longitudinal observations showed that exposure to technological advances was not significantly associated with high work
engagement.

2) Age moderated the relation between exposure to technological advances and high work engagement; younger workers had
higher work engagement.

How this study might affect research, practice, or policy

1) Exposure to technological advances such as artificial intelligence should be carefully implemented over a longer period, as such
exposure does not seem to relate positively to work engagement. Other resources are likely to be needed to help employees
exposed to technological advances maintain their work engagement.

Keywords: automation; job resources; technology; work performance; information; training.

Lee et al* have stated that workers exposed to more tech-
nological advances will likely experience greater job insecurity.
Other studies have identified potential job losses in occupations
susceptible to automation,°’’ and increases in mortality? poor
health conditions,’ and work-related injury or disease.*° Tech-
nological advances also change the characteristics and demands
of work by leading to greater work complexity, more mental
work tasks, workload changes, and work role expansion. However,
technological advances may also have positive effects by reducing
manual work and creating more new job opportunities.!' The
World Economic Forum has estimated that by 2025, although
85 million jobs will be displaced by automation, 97 million new
jobs will be created.’? These changes will probably depend on the
extent to which technological advances affect different job tasks
and job positions.

A previous study investigated how acceptance of technology
affected work engagement before the COVID-19 pandemic.'*
The study focused on workers whose work activity had recently
changed following the introduction of new technology, and
examined worker acceptance of new technology. However,
the conditions of exposure to technological advances in real
workplace settings may differ; not every worker is exposed to
the same extent and duration to newly installed technology.
Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected the
conditions and longitudinal effects of such exposure.

Workers’ exposure to technological advances increased during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Preventive measures such as physical
distancing required industries and workers to adapt to new habits
like working from home. Workers had to learn new modalities to
enable remote working support and install new technologies. The
pandemic may also have had psychological effects on workers,’*
which in turn may have affected worker performance.

In light of pandemic-related changes, there is a need to mea-
sure technological advances among workers in real workplace set-
tings using longitudinal data. It is also important to consider the
effect of work engagement as one aspect of workers’ psychological
performance profile. Such investigation is important to justify the
implementation of technological advances, adjusted to industry
characteristics, in countries such as Japan, which have a high
commitment to technological advances.

As we had defined work engagement as our dependent
variable, we used the job demands-resources model (JD-R) as
the framework for this study. According to the JD-R model, job
resources affect work engagement via motivational processes.
Job resources were defined as aspects of the job that are
functional in achieving work goals and reducing job demands
and the associated physiological and psychological costs.!° Our
hypothesis was that exposure to technological advances would
function as a job resource and would be associated with high
work engagement, following Beer and Mulder,‘! who concluded
that increased autonomy and reduced manual work were positive
effects of exposure to technology. As there is evidence for a
possible interaction between age and exposure to technological
advances, in that greater age tends to be associated with
less exposure to technological advances,’° we investigated the
interaction between age and exposure to technological advances.

2. Methods
2.1 Study design and participants

This was a prospective cohort study conducted in Japan. The
study was part of a nationwide online survey targeted to workers,
and covered all regions of Japan. The study protocol has been

published previously.’ The 27 693 participants registered in the
initial survey in the first year were screened to produce 16629
participants who responded in the second-year data collection
and who had complete data from the previous year. Details of the
comparison between respondents and nonrespondents are shown
in Table 1. Stratification sampling was carried out to represent
the conditions of the Japanese workforce.'* Data were collected in
February-March 2022 for the first year and February-March 2023
for the second year. Data collection was supported by a private
survey company that is officially registered in Japan and has 2.2
million registered members. Only individuals registered with the
company could respond to the survey. The study was approved by
the ethics committee of the University of Occupational and Envi-
ronmental Health, Japan (R3-076) and complies with the Checklist
for Reporting Results of Intemet E-Surveys (CHERRIES).’*

2.2 Work engagement

Work engagement was examined using the 9-item Japanese ver-
sion of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9).° Work
engagement was measured twice, at baseline and 1 year after
the first collection of data on exposure to technological advances.
Work engagement at baseline was used for model adjustment.
Responses to the 9 UWES-9 questions are on a Likert scale ranging
from 0 (never) to 6 (always). Data were presented numerically
using total scores; the minimum possible score was 0 and the
maximum possible score was 54.

2.3 Exposure to technological advances

Exposure to technological advances was measured using a single
question: “To what extent do you think your work will be affected
by technological advances such as Al and digital transformation?”
Participants were asked to respond on a Likert scale ranging from
1 to 7; a score of 1 represented not affected at all and a score of 7
represented greatly affected by technological advances.

2.4 Covariates

The covariates were age, sex, education, income, and industry
characteristics. Age was expressed numerically based on the data
from the online questionnaire. Sex was categorized as male or
female. Education level was determined according to the last
school that participants graduated from, and categorized as low
(junior high school and high school), medium (vocational school
and junior college/technical college), and high (university and
graduate school). Income was categorized according to 6 cate-
gories of annual income: less than 4 million yen, 4.0-5.99 million
yen, 6.0-7.99 million yen, 8.0-9.99 million yen, 10.0-12.0 million
yen, and more than 12.0 million yen. Industry characteristics were
measured according to the Japan Standard Industrial Classifi-
cation’! and categorized into 2 groups based on the likelihood
that jobs would be automated.’* Information and communica-
tion; wholesale and retail trades; finance and insurance; real
estate, goods, rental, and leasing; and education and learning
support were categorized as industries most likely to have their
jobs automated. Manufacturing; transport and postal services;
agriculture and forestry; fishery; mining and quarrying stone
and gravel; construction; electric; gas; heat and water supplies;
scientific research; professional and technical services; accom-
modation and eating and drinking services; living-related, per-
sonal, and amusement services; medical, health care, and welfare;
compound services; public services; and unlabeled services were
categorized as industries less likely to have their jobs automated.

2.5 Statistical analysis

We examined the distribution of data for covariates, exposure
to technological advances, and work engagement. Linear regres-
sion analysis was performed to examine the association between
exposure to technological advances and work engagement. Model
1 was generated with adjustment for age, sex, education, and
income. Model 2 was generated from Model 1 with additional
adjustment for industry characteristics. Model 3 was generated
from Model 2, with additional adjustment for the interaction
between age and exposure to technological advances. The Model
3 interaction results were used to inform further analysis to
examine the role of age. Model 4 was generated from Model 2 with
additional adjustment for work engagement score at baseline.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, Faculty Packs
version 29 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and Stata statistical software
(Release 17; StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA).

3. Results

Table 1 shows the demographic data of the participants. There
were 16 629 participants and most (71.3%) did not work in indus-
tries that were likely to be automated. The mean (SD) work
engagement score in year 1 (baseline) (22.2 [12.2]) was slightly
lower than that in year 2 (23.4 [10.7]). The mean work engagement
scores for both years were in the 50th percentile, indicating mod-
erate work engagement. Compared with respondents, nonrespon-
dents were more likely to be younger and female.

Table 2 shows the results of the simple linear regression
analysis of each variable, including exposure to technological
advances and work engagement in year 2. Exposure to techno-
logical advances was associated with high work engagement in
year 2.

Table 3 shows the results of the multiple linear regression
analysis. We found that exposure to technological advances was
associated with work engagement in year 2 even after adjust-
ment for age, sex, education, and income (Model 1), and after
additional adjustment for industry characteristics (Model 2). We
also observed that there was a statistically significant negative
coefficient for the interaction between age and exposure to tech-
nological advances (Model 3). The standardized coefficient of
the association between exposure to technological advances and
work engagement was 0.138 in this model. A multicollinearity test
of the models indicated low multicollinearity (the variance infla-
tion factor was less than 10) except for Model 3, which contained a
composite variable. However, in Model 4, the association between
exposure to technological advances and work engagement in
year 2 disappeared following adjustment for work engagement in
year 1

Table 4 shows the results of the multiple linear regression anal-
ysis stratified by age group (20-39 years, 40-59 years, and 60 years
or above). Exposure to technological advances was significantly
associated with work engagement in year 2 in all age groups, but
the regression coefficient tended to decrease as age increased.

4. Discussion

This study demonstrated an association between exposure
to technological advances and high work engagement, and
this outcome remained consistent after adjusting for several
variables, including personal characteristics, work characteristics,
and possible interaction variables. However, this relationship
was no longer significant after adjusting for baseline work
engagement, suggesting that exposure to technological advances
did not contribute to the improvement in work engagement over

the year. We also observed that age moderated this relationship,
and that younger workers had higher work engagement.
Compared with a study by Molino et al,’? which similarly
identified a positive association with work engagement, our
study measured technology exposure rather than acceptance
of technology. Exposure is related to workplace conditions,
whereas acceptance is more related to individual perspectives.
We examined age as a covariate, whereas Molino et al! defined it
as a control variable. Therefore, we were able to examine the role
of age in the relation between exposure to technological advances
and work engagement. We also used longitudinal data and
conducted the study after the COVID-19 pandemic. Sewall et al**
have stated that digital technology use during the COVID-19
pandemic did not induce depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation,
questioning the assumption that pandemic-related technology
use affected well-being. Therefore, it is possible that technology
use and technological advances had a positive effect, as shown in
our third model, during and after the pandemic situation
Although some studies on the role of exposure to technological
advances have found an association with negative outcomes such

as anxiety, depression, and job insecurity, we found that expo-
sure to technological advances was associated with high work
engagement when baseline work engagement was not adjusted
for. Our findings therefore indicate that exposure to technological
advances has a positive outcome. However, in real workplace
practice, if other job resources are available and baseline work
engagement is maintained, the association between exposure to
technological advances and work engagement may be reduced.
Our findings showed that baseline work engagement status
was strongly related to future work engagement. Employees with
good work engagement were likely to be better prepared to man-
age their work demands and allocate resources.** Moreover, they
may work more efficiently to achieve their goals; according to the
JD-R model, this is an indication of job crafting.“° The present find-
ings suggest that good baseline work engagement functions as a
good job resource, and contributes toward job crafting and better
subsequent work engagement. Thus, exposure to technological
advances seems to have less effect on future work engagement,
although a positive association was found in Model 3. Therefore,
our hypothesis was partly accepted; longitudinal observations

showed that exposure to technological advances was not signif-
icantly associated with work engagement.

The JD-R model helps to explain why exposure to technolog-
ical advances has a positive effect on work engagement.’? Work
engagement is known to increase according to the resources that
workers have; these include job resources and personal resources.
Technological advances may function as a job resource that helps
to make work more efficient.*° A reduction in manual work
supports workers in performing their tasks more efficiently. Fur-
thermore, workers have more autonomy in completing their work
tasks when using technological advances. Therefore, exposure to
technological advances functions mainly as a job resource that
makes work more efficient.

We also found that the effect of age may modify the association
between exposure to technological advances and work engage-
ment. The coefficient of the relationship reduced with increasing
age, and we concluded that (older) age had a moderating effect
on the association between exposure to technological advances
and work engagement. This may explain the recent finding that
although the adoption of technology has increased among older
people, it is still lower than among younger people.’® Younger
people may also be more likely to be engaged in jobs that are more
strongly affected by technological advances.

Our study included a large number of participants, used lon-
gitudinal data, and used data stratified to represent workforce
conditions in Japan, one of the countries with a stated high
commitment to technological advances.* We believe that our
findings reflect current conditions in the Japanese workforce and
perhaps conditions in other developed countries. Although most
of our participants were from industries less likely to have their
jobs automated, exposure to technological advances still played
an important role in work engagement if baseline levels of work
engagement were not taken into account.

There were several study limitations. First, we did not measure
both positive and negative outcomes related to exposure to tech-
nological advances. Second, to measure exposure to technological
advances, we used a numerical scale that possibly assessed both
positive and negative experiences of exposure. Participants with
similar scores may have had different experiences, either positive
or negative, of exposure to technological advances. Third, we were
aware of the risk of attrition bias owing to different characteristics
between respondents and nonrespondents; this may have caused
overestimation or underestimation when interpreting the results.
However, we believe that our data are similar to those from other
national surveys, and cover older workers who often work in the
informal economy or in contract-based jobs.

We suggest that future studies should simultaneously measure
both positive and negative outcomes of exposure to technologi-
cal advances and include assessment of the experience of such
exposure. This type of study is important for generating useful
information that could inform national policies on installing new
technology in industries.
