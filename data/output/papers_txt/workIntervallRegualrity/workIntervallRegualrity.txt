Abstract

Objectives: Several health issues are associated with irregular sleep patterns. However, it is unclear what causes workers to sleep
irregularly. The work interval (WI) between the end of one day’s working hours and the start of the next day’s working hours contains
sleep opportunities, and an irregular WI may result in irregular sleep. This study investigated this association among Japanese daytime
workers.

Methods: This study recruited 141 daytime workers without shiftwork for a 14-day observational study. Participants reported the WI
duration, WI timing, time in bed (TIB: difference between bedtime and wake-up time), and bedtime timing every day before bedtime.
The SD over 14 days was used to calculate the regularity scores. Logistic regression analysis was performed. The dependent variables
were >60 minutes of TIB SD and bedtime timing SD, whereas the independent variables were WI duration and timing SD.

Results: The odds ratios (ORs) (95% Cls) for >60 minutes of TIB SD across categories of WI duration SD were 1.000 (reference) for
<30 minutes, 1.344 (0.337-5.360) for 30-60 minutes, and 4.743 (1.441-15.607) for >60 minutes. The ORs (95% Cls) for >60 min of bedtime
timing SD across categories of WI timing SD were 1.000 for <30 minutes, 4.154 (1.574-10.965) for 30-60 minutes, and 7.714 (2.124-28.015)
for >60 minutes.

Conclusions: Regularity of WI was associated with regularity of sleep. To ensure worker health, workers should have regular WI, and if
they are exposed to irregular WI, they should make every effort to maintain regular sleep.

Key points

What is already known on this topic: Irregular sleep patterns are associated with several health issues, but it is unclear what causes
workers to sleep irregularly.

What this study adds: Regularity of work interval duration and timing was related to regularity of sleep. This result was also found
among workers who had not experienced work interval durations of <11 hours.

How this study might affect research, practice, or policy: Although the European Union working time directive or the work interval
system in Japan can guarantee a specific work interval duration, irregular sleep may not be prevented. To protect worker health,
workers should maintain regular work intervals, and if they experience irregular work intervals, they may need to maintain as regular
a sleep schedule as possible.

Keywords: work interval system; daily rest period; social rhythms.

Working hours may be one of the most influential factors for
sleep regularity for employees. For example, sleep/wake schedules
tend to differ between the workday, which reflects the social

Introduction

It is well known that insufficient quantity and quality of sleep is

associated with health issues, such as cardiovascular disease
(CVD)? and mental health disorders.*° In addition, it was
recently reported that sleep regularity is also a crucial factor
linking to health issues. For example, irregular sleep may be
associated with CVD risks,° a high prevalence of hypertension
and an increase in blood pressure,’® a decline in metabolic
health,?:*° and an increase in acute suicidal ideation.' As a result,
in addition to the quantity and quality of sleep, sleep regularity
may also be important to ensure health at work.

clock, and the nonworkday, which reflects the biological clock.
This phenomenon is referred to as social jetlag’? and affects
workers’ health’? and performance.’* Additionally, shiftwork
influences sleep regularity. The work schedules of shift workers
vary daily, and those who work the night shift must work when
they would normally be sleeping. This causes irregular sleep’
and adverse effects on workers’ health.'°’ However, irregular
sleep also occurs in spite of the absence of shiftwork and social
jetlag and is associated with CVD risks.° Therefore, factors other

than shiftwork and social jetlag may contribute to irregular sleep,
but these are unclear.

The duration of the daily work interval (WI) between the end of
one day’s working hours and the start of the next day’s working
hours includes activities and/or behaviors normally performed
outside of work hours, such as sleep, leisure time, commute time,
and other nonwork time. Consequently, a longer WI could result
in a longer sleep opportunity. In fact, previous research revealed
that employees with a shorter daily rest period had significantly
shorter sleep duration’® and extending the WI increases sleep
quantity.'° Sleep duration is associated with several health prob-
lems.':*;* Therefore, ensuring a certain WI duration is important
for worker health. The European Union (EU) working time direc-
tive stipulates that EU workers are entitled to take “a minimum
daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours every 24 hr.””° In Japan,
a “work interval system” requires employers to ensure workers
receive a certain number of hours between the end of one workday
and the start of the next.”* Although these directives and systems
mention WI duration, they do not address the interval’s regularity.
In other words, even if the WI duration over 11 hours results
in a certain sleep opportunity, irregular WI timing may occur,
resulting in irregular sleep. However, whether WI regularity and
sleep regularity are associated remains unclear.

Thus, this study examined the relationship between WI regu-
larity and sleep regularity among nonshiftwork daytime workers.
This study also hypothesized that irregular WIs would correlate
with irregular sleep. Since this study focused on WI and sleep
on workdays, nonworkday data were omitted from the analysis.
In addition, the targeted population of this study was daytime
workers in the “information and communications” industrial clas-
sification. Workers in this industry are assumed to have irregular
work schedules, as this industry had the second-longest overtime
work hours among all industry classifications in Japan,?? which
may be due to its working characteristics of tight deadlines,
customer support, and sudden changes in specification.?*

Methods
Participants

This study recruited participants from October 5 to October 10,
2018, via an outsourced third-party research company with a
database of voluntarily registered participants. The company sent
invitations to 2731 workers (18-59 years old) in the information
and communications industry who had previously registered. A
total of 1066 registered users accessed the survey website and
completed the screening survey (response rate: 39%). Participants
were excluded based on the following criteria: (1) those who were
not currently employed; (2) those who were shift or night workers;
(3) those with nonpermanent employment (eg, part-time or tem-
porary workers); and (4) those whose current industry type did not
fall under “information and communications.” The 283 workers
who met the aforementioned criteria were included in the obser-
vational study. All participants provided web-based informed con-
sent. The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health, Japan (H2916).

Procedures

The 14-day observational study was conducted from October 15
to October 28, 2018. During the observation period, participants
were required to complete the survey daily before bedtime. Every
evening, participants were emailed a survey. After the observation

period, participants completed a post-survey regarding demo-
graphic data and their characteristics (eg, sleep quality) until
November 2, 2018.

Measurements

Regarding WI variables, the start and end of the day’s working
hours were requested. WI duration was determined as the time
between the end of one day’s working hours and the start of the
next day’s working hours. In addition, the midpoint of the WI
(ie, WI timing) was calculated using the following formula: end
of working hours + WI duration/2. Meanwhile, WI regularity was
measured using the SD of the 14-day observation period in WI
duration and WI timing. Since this study focused on the regularity
of workday WIs, nonworkday WI data (ie, WI durations longer
than 24 hours) were excluded from the calculation of regularity.

Regarding sleep variables, the previous bedtime and morning
wake-up time were asked. The interval between bedtime and rise
time was computed based on time in bed (TIB). The SD of the
14 observation days in TIB was used to quantify the regularity
of sleep duration. In addition, the SD of bedtime over the 14-
day observation period was used to quantify the regularity of
sleep timing based on previous studies that used bedtime or sleep
onset.®.° The sleep data before and/or after the nonworkday (ie,
data during WIs of >24 hours) were excluded from the calculation
of regularity because the focus of this study was on the regularity
of sleep on workdays.

Post-survey

The collected information about the participants’ characteristics
included sex, height, weight (body mass index, BMI), one-way
commute time, marital status (single or married), smoking status
(current smoker, ex-smoker, or nonsmoker), and alcohol status
(0, 1-2, 3-5, or >6 d/wk). In addition, the Japanese version of
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-J)** was administered to
assess the sleep quality. The PSQI-J consists of 18 questions, and
the total score ranges from 0 to 21, which indicates sleep quality.
The higher the score, the more severe the sleep complaints. The
threshold for primary insomnia has been set at 5.5.

Analyses

Some participants may have given incorrect responses due to
confusion between AM and PM. Therefore, in this study, “AM” and
“PM” were changed to “PM” and “AM,” respectively, when confusion
arose between “AM” and “PM” and when the answers met the
following criteria: (1) the time order of the previous bedtime,
wake-up time, start of working hours, and end of working hours
was incorrect, and (2) the TIB and/or the WI duration (working
hours) was disproportionately large or small. In addition, incorrect
responses with the same time of day for bedtime and wake-up
time and the same time of day for the start and end of working
hours were eliminated.

Spearman correlation analysis was used to establish the rela-
tionships between sleep regularity (TIB SD and bedtime timing
SD) and continuous variables. In addition, the Mann-Whitney U
test was used to determine sleep regularity differences between
groups of categorical variables. The variables that were signif-
icantly correlated with sleep regularity and showed significant
differences between category groups were used as covariates in
the following multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Since the TIB SD, bedtime timing SD, and log-transformed
values were not normally distributed according to the Shapiro-
Wilk test, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed
to explore the relationship between WI regularity (duration and

timing) and sleep regularity (duration and timing). The dependent
variables were the >60 minutes of TIB SD and >60 minutes of bed-
time timing SD. The independent variables were WI duration SD
and WI timing SD. However, due to a high correlation between WI
duration SD and WI timing SD (spearman correlation coefficient
rs =0.930, P <.001), this study examined their associations with
sleep regularity independently in all logistic regression analyses.
WI duration SD (<30 min [n=47], 30-60 min [n=45], and >60 min
({n=49]) and WI timing SD (<30 min [n= 90], 30-60 min [n= 38], and
>60 min [n=13]) were used to categorize the participants. The
<30 min (the most regular) group was chosen as the reference.
In addition, the WI duration SD and WI timing SD data were set
as continuous variables to independent variables based on the
strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemi-
ology (STROBE) statements.

Moreover, sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the
robustness of the results. The above logistic regression analysis
was repeated, focusing on workers who had never experienced a
WI duration of <11 hours during the observation period.

Furthermore, Spearman correlation analysis was used to
explore the relationships between WI regularity (WI duration SD
and WI timing SD) and WI regularity-related factors (WI duration
mean, WI timing mean, start of working hours mean, start of
working hours SD, end of working hours mean, end of working
hours SD, working hours mean, and working hours SD).

SPSS version 23.0 for Microsoft Windows was used to conduct
all statistical analyses (SPSS Software Inc.)

Results

A total of 145 employees completed the 14-day observation survey
and post-survey (response rate: 51%). Three participants who
lacked bedtime and/or wake-up time data for more than 10 days
and 1 participant who performed shiftwork (night work) for a
week were excluded from further analyses. The final sample size
included 141 employees who responded for all days for the 14-day
observation period.

Table 1 presents the demographic data. The median TIB SD,
median bedtime SD, median WI duration SD, and median WI
timing SD were 0.5, 0.4, 0.7, and 0.4 hours, respectively.

Regarding univariate analyses, the Mann-Whitney U test for
TIB SD and bedtime timing SD showed no significant differences
(P > .05) by sex (female or male), marital status (married or sin-
gle), smoking status (smoker or non-/ex-smoker), alcohol status
(nonconsumption or >1/wk), or PSQI cut-off score (>6 or <6). In
addition, the Spearman correlation analyses (Table 2) revealed
that TIB SD was significantly correlated with WI duration SD
(rs =0.364, P <.001) and WI timing mean (rs =0.211, P=.012) and
SD (rs=0.370, P=.001). Moreover, bedtime timing SD was signif-
icantly correlated with WI duration SD (rs=0.366, P< .001) and
WI timing mean (rs=0.281, P=.001) and SD (rs=0.372, P=.001).
However, age, BMI, commute time, WI duration mean, and PSQI
score were not correlated with TIB SD and bedtime SD (P > .05).
As a result, the mean of WI timing was accounted for as a
confounding factor.

The numbers of workers with >60 minutes of TIB SD and
bedtime timing SD were 24 and 27, respectively (Table 3). Regard-
ing the WI duration SD, when the WI duration SD was set as a
continuous variable, logistic regression analysis revealed that the
crude odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) associated with a 1-hour increase
in the WI duration SD was 2.509 (1.406-4.477) for >60 minutes of
TIB SD and 2.432 (1.388-4.262) for >60 minutes of bedtime timing
SD. When WI duration SD was set as a categorical variable, logistic

regression analysis for >60 min of TIB SD revealed that, relative to
the reference, the crude OR (95% Cl) was 1.344 (0.337-5.360) for 30-
60 minutes and 4.743 (1.441-15.607) for >60 minutes. In addition,
logistic regression analysis for >60 minutes of bedtime timing SD
revealed that the crude OR (95% Cl) was 1.980 (0.538-7.293) for 30-

with the reference. These significant associations remained after
adjusting for the confounding factor.

Regarding the WI timing SD, logistic regression analysis
revealed that the crude OR (95% Cl) associated with a 1-hour
increase in the WI timing SD was 8.911 (2.667-29.776) for
>60 minutes of TIB SD and 9.301 (2.850-30.348) for >60 minutes
of bedtime timing SD. When the WI timing SD was set as a
categorical variable, logistic regression analysis for >60 minutes
of TIB SD revealed that the crude OR (95% Cl) was 3.661 (1.315-
10.192) for 30-60 minutes and 8.786 (2.371-32.561) for >60 minutes
compared with the reference. In addition, logistic regression
analysis for >60 minutes bedtime timing SD revealed a crude
OR (95% Cl) of 4.154 (1.574-10.965) for 30-60 minutes and 7.714
(2.124-28.015) for >60 minutes compared with the reference.
These significant associations remained after adjusting for the
confounding factor.

Table 4 shows the results of sensitivity analysis, focusing
only on workers who had never experienced a WI duration
of <11 hours during the observation period (n=133). Similar
relationships existed between WI regularity and sleep regularity.

Discussion

This study examined the relationship between WI regularity
(duration and timing) and sleep regularity (duration and timing)
in daytime workers without shiftwork. Results indicated that
irregular WI duration and timing were significantly associated
with irregular sleep duration and timing, and these associations
persisted when analyzing only the participants who had never

experienced a WI duration of <11 hours during the observation
period. These results suggest that day-to-day variation in WI
duration and/or timing is associated with sleep regularity in
the absence of shiftwork and the gap between workdays and
nonworkdays, both of which have a substantial impact on sleep
regularity.

This result supports our hypothesis that irregular WI duration
and timing are associated with irregular sleep duration and
timing. WI includes the sleep opportunity, and irregular WI
duration may result in irregular sleep opportunities. According
to a previous study, the average WI duration in the preceding
month was correlated with the average TIB in the preceding
month,® and it is believed that if the WI duration varies from
day to day, sleep duration may also vary, leading to irregular
sleep. In addition, WI timing regularity was associated with sleep
timing regularity, meaning that irregular WI timing is associated
with irregular sleep timing. This result may be attributable
to irregular WI timing that includes sleep opportunities that
may also result in irregular sleep timing. Previous studies also
reported that shiftwork, especially with the night shift, also
causes irregular sleep/wake schedules (timing)‘* and poses a
risk of several health problems such as fatigue, sleep problems,
and CVD.'®'”2° This study newly found that irregular WI timing
without shiftwork may also be associated with an increased
risk of irregular sleep timing. Huang et al® found that irregular
sleep duration and timing were associated with cardiovascular
events, and the relationship remained when shift workers were
excluded. In addition, previous studies have reported that regular
sleep is associated with many health issues.°-1° Therefore,
even daytime employees who do not work shifts should take
regular WIs.

WI duration and timing were also correlated with sleep
timing and duration, respectively. Sleep duration regularity was
highly correlated with regularity of sleep timing, and this result
was consistent with a previous study,*° suggesting that when

workers shift their sleep duration, they also shift their sleep
timing. In addition, there was a strong correlation between
regularity of WI duration and regularity of WI timing. This
association may explain the significant correlation between
regularity of WI duration and regularity of sleep timing,
and between regularity of WI timing and regularity of sleep
duration.

Furthermore, sensitivity analysis showed that the significant
relationship between WI regularity and sleep regularity remained
when participants with WI durations of <11 hours were excluded.
These results suggest that even if the workers could ensure a WI of
>11 hours as per the EU working time directive (minimum daily
rest period of 11 consecutive hours every 24 hours)*° or the WI

system in Japan,' their sleep regularity may become irregular. In
addition, irregular sleep causes a number of health problems.°-"°
As a countermeasure, workers should avoid irregular duration
and timing of WIs as much as possible. In addition, workers with
irregular WIs should alter their sleep duration and timing as little
as possible.

This study focused on WI, which includes sleep opportunities,
and examined the relationship between sleep regularity and WI
regularity. Working hours and WI were calculated from the start
and end of working hours, and the relationship between WI and
working hours is like 2 sides of the same coin. As a result, the
working hours SD was highly correlated with WI regularity and
may be related to sleep regularity. Furthermore, WI regularity
was correlated with the start and end of working hours SD, in
particular, with the end of working hours SD. Many workers who
do not use the flextime or discretionary labor systems may have
a fixed start time for work. As a result, the irregular WI and
irregular sleep reported in this study could be attributed primarily
to the irregular end of working hours. Meanwhile, if workers who
use the WI system finish their shifts late and the WI falls below
11 hours, their start time for the next day will be delayed as well.
This indicates that, compared with workers with a fixed start of
working hours, the WI system can result in a certain duration
of the WI but delay the phase of WI due to a delayed start in
working hours, causing irregular WI. Therefore, workers under the
WI system should try to maintain as much sleep duration and
timing as possible.

This study has a number of limitations. First, a web survey
was used to collect data for this study, which may have intro-
duced sampling bias. Second, self-reports were used to mea-
sure the start and end of working hours (WI duration and tim-
ing), bedtime, and wake-up time (TIB and sleep timing). Addi-
tional research employing objective measures such as atten-
dance record (objective work schedules) and actigraphy (objective
sleep variables) is required. Third, this study was conducted in
2018, that is, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Following COVID-
19, the work-from-home setting has been rapidly and widely
implemented in recent years, particularly in Japan's “information
and communications” industry.’ Working from home can reduce
commuting time, affecting sleep duration and regularity. How-
ever, no information about working from home was requested
in this study. More research is needed to consider the effects of
the work-from-home system on sleep duration and regularity.
Fourth, this study did not inquire about a history of CVD events
linked to irregular sleep.° As irregular WI was linked to irregu-
lar sleep, irregular WI may be indirectly linked to CVD events
through irregular sleep. More research is needed to clarify this
relationship.

Conclusion

Regularity of WI duration and timing was related to regularity
of sleep. This result was also found among workers who had not
experienced WI durations of <11 hours, indicating that although
the EU working time directive or the WI system in Japan can guar-
antee a specific WI duration, irregular sleep may not be prevented.
Irregular sleep leads to several health problems. Therefore, to
protect worker health, workers should maintain regular WIs, and
if they experience irregular WIs, they may need to maintain as
regular a sleep schedule as possible.
