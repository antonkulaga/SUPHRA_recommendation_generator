**Emotional Disclosure and Productivity Improvement** **Key Findings:** 1. **Emotional Disclosure**: Writing or talking about stressful events can improve cognitive changes,
self-esteem, and adaptive coping strategies. 2. **Verbal vs. Written Disclosure**: Verbal disclosure was more effective in reducing EBV antibody titers
(indicating better cellular immune control) compared to written disclosure. Verbal disclosure also showed higher ratings for cognitive change, self-esteem improvements,
and adaptive coping strategies. 3. **Personality Correlates**: Individuals classified as repressors (those who deny negative feelings) had higher EBV antibody
titers, suggesting poorer immunological control of latent EBV. 4. **Emotional Expression**: Greater expression of negative emotional words and cognitive reappraisal
predicted decreases in EBV antibody titers. **Recommendations for Productivity Improvement:** 1. **Emotional Disclosure**: Engage in verbal or written disclosure of
stressful events to improve cognitive changes, self-esteem, and adaptive coping strategies. 2. **Verbal Disclosure**: Prioritize verbal disclosure over written disclosure
for more effective results. 3. **Personal Development**: Develop adaptive coping strategies, such as self-awareness and emotional regulation, to improve immunological
control of latent viruses. 4. **Time Management**: Allocate time for emotional disclosure and self-reflection to reduce stress and improve cognitive
changes. **Time-Bound Information:** No specific time-bound recommendations were provided in the study, but the interventions were conducted over a 3-week
period, with significant changes observed in EBV antibody titers. **General Applicability:** The findings are relevant to a broad audience, as
emotional disclosure and self-awareness are essential skills for managing stress and improving cognitive changes, regardless of age, occupation, or educational
background. **Authors and Publication:** This study was published in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, Vol. 62, No. 1,
in 1994. The authors include Brian A. Esterling, Michael H. Antoni, Mary Ann Fletcher, Scott Margulies, and Neil Schneiderman.
