**Summary of Key Findings Related to Improving Productivity and Self-Improvement** * **Technological Advances**: Exposure to technological advances is not significantly
associated with work engagement in the long term. However, it can have a positive effect on work engagement, especially for
younger workers, by providing autonomy and reducing manual work. * **Job Demands-Resources Model (JD-R)**: The JD-R model can help explain
why exposure to technological advances has a positive effect on work engagement. Technological advances can function as a job resource
that makes work more efficient, and workers with good baseline work engagement are better prepared to manage their work demands
and allocate resources. * **Age**: Age moderates the relationship between exposure to technological advances and work engagement. Younger workers tend
to have higher work engagement when exposed to technological advances. * **Work Engagement**: Baseline work engagement is strongly related to
future work engagement. Employees with good work engagement are likely to be better prepared to manage their work demands and
allocate resources. **Practical, Time-Bound Recommendations** * **Use Technological Advances to Automate Repetitive Tasks**: Implement technological advances to automate manual work
and provide autonomy to workers, especially younger workers. (Time-bound: within the next 3-6 months) * **Provide Training and Development Opportunities**:
Provide training and development opportunities to help workers manage their work demands and allocate resources effectively. (Time-bound: within the next
6-12 months) * **Monitor and Evaluate Work Engagement**: Regularly monitor and evaluate work engagement to identify areas for improvement and
provide support to workers who need it. (Time-bound: within the next 6-12 months) * **Encourage Older Workers to Adopt Technological
Advances**: Encourage older workers to adopt technological advances and provide support to help them manage their work demands and allocate
resources effectively. (Time-bound: within the next 6-12 months) **Authors and Publication Date** This study was conducted by Nuri Purwito Adi,
