**Summary of Key Findings:** The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of two happiness strategies: expressing gratitude (Gratitude) and visualizing
best possible selves (BPS), in increasing and sustaining positive emotions over a four-week period. **Key Takeaways:** * Both Gratitude and
BPS exercises produced immediate reductions in negative affect, compared to a control condition (Focus on daily details). * However, only
the BPS exercise produced a significant increase in immediate positive affect, which was sustained over the four-week period. * Participants
who performed the BPS exercise reported higher self-concordant motivation (SCM) than those in the control condition, indicating that they were
more engaged and motivated to continue with the exercise. * SCM predicted exercise performance, suggesting that participants who were more
engaged and motivated were more likely to continue with the exercise. * The BPS exercise had a stronger effect on
sustained positive mood than the other two exercises, as evidenced by the interaction between SCM and exercise performance. * The
study's findings suggest that longer-term emotional benefits require persistent effort to achieve, and that the "fit" of the exercise with
the participant's personality, interests, and goals played an important role in determining its effectiveness. **Recommendations:** 1. **Practice Gratitude**: Set aside
time each day to reflect on the things you are grateful for, no matter how small they may seem. 2.
**Visualize Best Possible Selves**: Take time to imagine your ideal future self, including your goals, aspirations, and values. This can
help to increase motivation and self-concordance. 3. **Find Meaningful Exercises**: Engage in activities that align with your values and interests,
as these are more likely to be sustained over time. 4. **Make Exercise a Habit**: Incorporate exercises such as Gratitude
and BPS into your daily routine, and aim to perform them consistently over a prolonged period. 5. **Be Consistent**: Consistency
is key when it comes to exercise performance. Aim to perform exercises at the same time each day or week.
**Time-Bound Recommendations:** * Practice Gratitude for 5-10 minutes each day * Visualize Best Possible Selves for 10-15 minutes each day
* Aim to perform exercises at the same time each day or week to make them a habit * Incorporate
exercises into daily routine, such as during morning or evening meditation **Physical and Mental Health:** * Regular exercise can help
to reduce negative affect and improve overall well-being * Mindfulness practices, such as Gratitude and BPS, can help to increase
self-awareness and self-regulation * Engaging in activities that align with values and interests can help to increase motivation and reduce
stress **Environmental Factors:** * A supportive environment that encourages exercise performance can help to increase motivation and self-concordance * Having
a dedicated space for exercise can help to create a routine and make exercise more accessible **Personal Development Strategies:** *
Engaging in exercises that align with values and interests can help to increase motivation and self-concordance * Setting goals and
working towards them can help to increase self-awareness and self-regulation * Practicing mindfulness and self-reflection can help to increase self-awareness
and self-regulation **Mindfulness and Mental Well-being:** * Mindfulness practices, such as Gratitude and BPS, can help to increase self-awareness and
self-regulation * Engaging in activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction can help to improve overall well-being * Practicing self-compassion
